// Per-stack object-store credentials (issue #1094, core fix from #1089).
//
// BEFORE: every provisioned stack's object store was created with the SAME
// process-global root credential — `RootUser: 'admin'` plus the single
// deployment-wide `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` (routes/provision.ts, and the matching
// literals in services/workspace-stack.ts and services/encore-s3-config.ts).
// One leaked credential therefore opened EVERY tenant's object store, and the
// credential could not be rotated for one stack without breaking all of them.
//
// AFTER: each stack's object store is created with its OWN access key id and
// secret access key, minted under a per-issue GENERATION nonce so that a
// re-provision of a torn-down stack name gets a genuinely new credential
// rather than a replay of the retired one (see GENERATION below). The
// credential is DERIVED, not randomly generated and stored in full, for three
// reasons that matter on this platform:
//
//   1. OSC secrets are WRITE-ONLY. `saveSecret(serviceId, name, value, ctx)`
//      POSTs to `/mysecrets/<serviceId>` (@osaas/client-core
//      lib/core.js:355-369) and the SDK exposes NO read-back and NO delete
//      (lib/index.d.ts exports only `saveSecret`/`valueOrSecret` for secrets).
//      So a randomly generated secret could never be recovered by the API
//      process that must speak S3 directly (presigned uploads, bucket reads).
//   2. The parameter store must never hold a secret — storeStackConfig asserts
//      it (assertNoCredentials, services/param-store.ts) — so the secret cannot
//      be persisted alongside the endpoint either.
//   3. Provisioning is idempotent (#417): a retried provision ADOPTS the
//      existing object-store instance. A freshly randomised secret on each retry
//      would diverge from the credential the live instance was created with.
//      A derivation keyed on the stack is stable across retries by construction.
//
// Derivation (HMAC-SHA256, domain-separated, keyed on a STRETCHED seed):
//   key             = scrypt(seed, fixed salt, N=2^15, r=8)                 (32 bytes)
//   accessKeyId     = 'ovc' + HMAC(key, '<id ctx>/<stackName>[/g=<gen>]')   (hex, 20 chars)
//   secretAccessKey = HMAC(key, '<secret ctx>/<accessKeyId>')               (base64url, 40 chars)
// The stretching is what makes a leaked credential expensive — not merely
// inconvenient — to turn back into the seed; see "HOW STRONG THE CROSS-STACK
// ISOLATION ACTUALLY IS" below.
//
// GENERATION (issue #1094, review follow-up). The derivation above is a pure
// function of its inputs, so with only (seed, stackName) as inputs a stack name
// that is torn down and provisioned again would be handed back the IDENTICAL
// credential — and teardown cannot retire the old one, because the OSC secrets
// API is write-only (no delete, see reason 1 below). Anyone who held the old
// stack's secret would therefore hold the new stack's secret. The `generation`
// input closes that: it is a 64-bit random nonce minted ONCE, by the caller, at
// the moment a credential is ISSUED for a stack that has none
// (`newObjectStoreCredentialGeneration()` + provision's call to
// `planObjectStoreCredential`). Randomness lives in the CALLER so every
// function here stays pure and the decision table stays unit-testable.
//
// The generation never needs to be persisted: it only shapes the accessKeyId,
// and the accessKeyId IS persisted (`StackConfig.objectStoreAccessKeyId`) and
// is the ground truth of what the live instance was created with. Every read
// path re-derives the secret from the STORED id, so a retried/idempotent
// provision (#417) and every later read stay stable within a generation while
// a fresh issue starts a new one. `generation` omitted / empty means
// GENERATION ZERO — the pre-generation derivation, byte-identical to the
// credentials already issued by earlier builds of this module, so already-live
// stacks keep working.
//
// The accessKeyId is NON-SECRET (it is an identifier, like a username — the
// same classification the #212 external-credential mapping uses, see the
// `accessKeyId` comment in services/external-storage-credentials.ts:33) and is
// persisted as `StackConfig.objectStoreAccessKeyId`. The secret is derived from
// the accessKeyId, so the read path needs only the stored id + the seed and
// never the stack name — one fewer input to get wrong.
//
// SEED. The seed is the deployment's existing `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`. That is
// deliberate and costs no new configuration or migration: the value is already
// required at provision time and already available to every path that needs a
// credential. The seed is never used as a credential on a migrated stack.
// Rotating the seed invalidates the derived credentials of already-provisioned
// stacks — exactly as rotating MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD already does today, since
// the live instances keep the password they were created with. No new
// operational constraint.
//
// HOW STRONG THE CROSS-STACK ISOLATION ACTUALLY IS (reviewed, and stated
// precisely rather than absolutely). HMAC is one-way, so a stack's credential
// does not *reveal* the seed algebraically. But the seed is an operator-chosen
// password, and the derived secret is handed out widely as a plaintext
// create-body / job-body field (encore-scaler/instance-pool.ts,
// pipeline/osc-thumbnail.ts). So anyone holding ONE leaked (id, secret) pair
// can mount an OFFLINE GUESSING attack on the seed — each candidate seed is
// confirmed by recomputing the secret for that (public, parameter-store-stored)
// id — and a recovered seed yields every other stack's secret plus the legacy
// `admin` + seed credential of every not-yet-migrated stack. The isolation
// property is therefore CONDITIONAL on the seed being expensive to guess, and
// two mechanisms below make that condition hold instead of assuming it:
//
//   1. KEY STRETCHING (deriveStretchedSeedKey). Every HMAC here is keyed on
//      scrypt(seed) rather than on the raw password, so a guess costs one
//      scrypt evaluation (N=2^15, r=8 — 32 MiB and, measured on a CI-class
//      box, ~120 ms) instead of one keyed HMAC (~2.8 us measured the same
//      way): a ~4.3e4 increase in the price of each guess, paid once per
//      process by us because the stretched key is memoised per seed.
//   2. A MINIMUM SEED STRENGTH (assessObjectStoreCredentialSeed). Stretching
//      only buys a constant factor, so a genuinely weak seed would still fall.
//      A seed that does not clear MINIMUM_OBJECT_STORE_SEED_ENTROPY_BITS is
//      NOT used to issue new per-stack credentials at all:
//      planObjectStoreCredential treats it like an absent seed and keeps the
//      stack on the legacy deployment-wide credential, which is exactly the
//      pre-#1094 behaviour — no worse than today, and it never hands out a
//      derived secret whose seed is cheap to recover. Provisioning logs the
//      downgrade so an operator can fix the deployment (routes/provision.ts).
//
// The strength gate deliberately does NOT apply to the READ path
// (resolveObjectStoreCredential) or to the reuse branch of
// planObjectStoreCredential: a live instance was created with the derived
// credential, so refusing to re-derive it would lock the API out of a working
// stack rather than improve anything. Enforcement belongs at ISSUE time only.
//
// Because of (1), the derived values are NOT byte-compatible with the
// pre-stretching derivation. No released build issues these credentials — the
// per-stack derivation lands with this change (#1094) and `main` has no
// `objectStoreAccessKeyId` producer — so there is nothing live to keep
// compatible. Verified before changing the derivation:
// `git grep -c objectStoreAccessKeyId origin/main -- src` -> 0 matches.
//
// WHAT "ROTATABLE PER STACK" MEANS HERE, PRECISELY. One stack's credential can
// be reissued without touching any other stack's: minting a new generation
// yields a new (id, secret) pair for that stack alone, and the pair a different
// stack resolves is unchanged because it is keyed on that stack's own stored
// id. What this module does NOT do is push the new pair onto a LIVE object
// store: the credential is the OSC instance's root user, and an adopted
// instance keeps the root user it was created with (see
// planObjectStoreCredential). So reissue takes effect for a stack that is
// (re-)created, which is why a reused stack name must not replay the retired
// credential — the generation nonce is what prevents that.
//
// NO SECRET IS LOGGED OR RETURNED. Every function here is pure and returns the
// credential to its caller; nothing in this module logs. Callers put the secret
// only into (a) `saveSecret`, (b) an OSC create-instance body as a
// `{{secrets.*}}` REFERENCE, or (c) an S3 client constructor.
//
// STILL OPEN (tracked, NOT claimed as done by this module):
//   - #1095, scoping a key to only this stack's source + packaged buckets. The
//     credential here is the object store's ROOT user, which is an admin
//     identity on its own instance, so it is confined to one stack's buckets
//     only in the sense that the instance holds nothing else. A genuinely
//     bucket-scoped, non-admin key needs a policy-bound object-store user,
//     which the object-store JS SDK cannot create — see
//     OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET_SCOPE_LIMITATION below.
//   - #1096, migrating already-provisioned stacks and REMOVING the legacy
//     fallback. Until that lands, a stack whose stored config carries no
//     `objectStoreAccessKeyId` keeps using the legacy `admin` + seed
//     credential, byte-identically to the pre-#1094 behaviour.

// WHY #1095 (bucket-scoped keys) CANNOT BE SATISFIED BY THIS MODULE ALONE.
// Verified against the contracts, not assumed:
//   - the only credential fields this repo's object-store create body carries
//     are `RootUser` + `RootPassword` (routes/provision.ts:1006-1007). NOTE:
//     this is the repo's usage, NOT the upstream OSC service schema, which
//     could not be fetched here — whether the service exposes any additional
//     user/policy field MUST be confirmed against the OSC service schema
//     before #1095 is designed. On the usage as it stands, the key a stack is
//     provisioned with is that instance's ROOT user.
//   - creating a non-root user restricted to `arn:aws:s3:::<source>/*` and
//     `arn:aws:s3:::<packaged>/*` therefore needs the object store's ADMIN API
//     (add-canned-policy + add-user / add-service-account). The object-store JS
//     client (`minio@^8`) exposes no admin surface: `makeRequestAsync` is its
//     only signed escape hatch (node_modules/minio/dist/main/internal/
//     client.d.ts:156, options type `RequestOption = Partial<IRequest> & ...`
//     with `path` from IRequest), and while that can reach an admin path, the
//     add-user and add-service-account bodies must be encrypted with the admin
//     secret, which the client does not implement.
//   - bucket POLICIES (the SDK's setBucketPolicy, already used for the public
//     packaged-read policy in routes/provision.ts) cannot substitute: they bind
//     a principal, and a root/admin identity is not constrained by them.
// So #1095 needs either an OSC object-store option for a scoped user, or an
// admin-API-capable client. Logged as OSC friction; the constant below exists
// so call sites can reference the limitation instead of restating it.
