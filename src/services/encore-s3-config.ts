// Resolve the object-store (MinIO) coordinates each spawned Encore instance is
// configured with, from the provisioned stack's own config.
//
// This is the seam issue #804's symptom surfaced at. The scaler passes the
// returned config into the Encore instance-create body as `s3Endpoint` /
// `s3AccessKeyId` / `s3SecretAccessKey` / `s3Region`
// (src/encore-scaler/instance-pool.ts:368-372), and those fields are set ONLY
// when a config is present. A transcode job's input is an `s3://<bucket>/<key>`
// URI (src/pipeline/transcode.ts:120) with no host in it, so an Encore instance
// spawned WITHOUT `s3Endpoint` resolves that URI against the public AWS S3
// endpoint instead of the stack's own object store and fails with a 404 that
// names nothing.
//
// Pre-#804, provision.ts wrote the stack config under a DERIVED namespace while
// this read used the constant, so on any deployment where those differed the
// read missed, this resolver returned undefined, and the miss was invisible
// until a transcode 404'd. Two things fix that:
//   1. the namespace is now the constant STACK_CONFIG_NAMESPACE on both sides
//      (issue #804), so the read key equals the write key by construction;
//   2. this resolver FAILS LOUD — it throws rather than returning undefined
//      when no endpoint is resolvable and there is no static env-var fallback,
//      so a config miss surfaces as a failed transcode submission that names
//      the cause instead of an unexplained 404 from the transcoder.
//
// ORDERING INVARIANT — read this before wiring resolveEncoreS3Config onto a
// NEW call path.
//
// This resolver reads paramStore.loadStackConfig(STACK_CONFIG_NAMESPACE, …)
// DIRECTLY. It deliberately does NOT go through the #804 migration helpers
// (WorkspaceStackResolver.loadStackConfigWithMigration /
// listStackNamesWithMigration, src/services/workspace-stack.ts), which adopt a
// pre-#804 stack config written under a derived namespace and rewrite it under
// the constant.
//
// That is safe TODAY only because of an ordering invariant spanning three
// modules, not because of anything this module enforces:
//
//   1. main.ts resolves the stack's Valkey URL via resolveStackRedisUrl
//      (services/scaler-redis-url.ts), which goes through
//      WorkspaceStackResolver.resolveStackConfig() and therefore RUNS the
//      migration — rewriting any stale config under STACK_CONFIG_NAMESPACE.
//   2. Only if that resolves does main.ts call activateScaler(redisUrl), which
//      constructs the scaler registry that owns `resolveS3Config`.
//   3. resolveEncoreS3Config is reachable ONLY as that registry's
//      `resolveS3Config` callback, so by the time it runs, step 1 has already
//      migrated the key it reads.
//
// In other words: the scaler activation path migrates BEFORE this function is
// ever invoked, so a direct constant-namespace read cannot miss a config the
// migration would have found.
//
// If you call this from anywhere that is NOT downstream of scaler activation —
// a route handler, a CLI script, a sweep, a new background worker — that
// invariant no longer holds, and on a not-yet-migrated deployment this read
// will MISS and now THROW (fail-loud, below) instead of silently degrading.
// In that case, resolve through the migration helpers first, or take a
// resolver-backed read path rather than paramStore directly.
//

  // StackConfig.minioEndpoint by the stack resolver, which this hook is not

// `ENCORE_S3_ENDPOINT` value cannot reach this function at all: when a complete
// static pair is configured AND no stack endpoint resolves, this resolver
// returns `undefined` and the registry uses its own `s3Config` built from the
// env vars verbatim (workspace-registry.ts:206-209, main.ts `s3Config`). The
// operator override is therefore honoured by a DIFFERENT code path that this
// hook is not wired into.
//
// The earlier `|| staticFallbackConfigured` gate confused those two things. It
// did not protect the static value (which never passes through here), and it
// silently disabled the #991 fix for any operator who had left
// `ENCORE_S3_ENDPOINT` set while actually being served from a provisioned
// stack: they lost the ingress fix AND their static value went unused. Gating
// on where the endpoint came from — which is unconditional at this call site —
// is the correct rule.
//
// The hook is contracted never to throw, but if a caller ever wires one that
// does, a spawn must not fail because of an optimisation: the throw is logged
// and the PUBLIC endpoint is used, which is exactly the pre-#991 behaviour.
