// The scaler is an Encore-compatible proxy: callers speak the same

// Encore OSC instances that the scaler spawns and tears down on demand.
//
// Contract sources verified before writing (per CLAUDE.md rule 7):

//       removeInstance(context, serviceId, name, token): Promise<void>
//       waitForInstanceReady(serviceId, name, ctx): Promise<void>
//     The returned instance object exposes `url` and `name` (see the
//     ServiceInstance typedef + instanceUrl() in src/routes/provision.ts).
//   - Context.getServiceAccessToken(serviceId): Promise<string>
