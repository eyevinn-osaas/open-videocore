//   1. Count pending jobs (LLEN encore:queue).
//   2. Load the instance pool from Valkey.
//   3. Scale up: if there is pending work, every instance is busy, and the pool
//      is below maxInstances, spawn one instance (one per tick — spawns are
//      slow, so we grow gradually rather than stampede).
//   4. Scale down: destroy idle instances whose idle age exceeds idleTimeoutMs.
//   5. Dispatch: for each instance with spare capacity, atomically move a job
//      from the queue to the inflight list (RPOPLPUSH), POST it to the instance,
//      and record the job->instance mapping + status. On dispatch failure the
//      job is returned to the queue so it is retried, never lost.
//
// Idempotency / crash-safety: the RPOPLPUSH into encore:inflight means a job is
// only removed from the queue once it is claimed for a specific POST attempt; a
// failed POST re-queues it. The pool + mapping hashes are the durable state, so
// a restarted loop resumes from Valkey rather than in-memory bookkeeping.

//     index sees the job, and the drop is suppressed for good.

  //     instance-pool.ts:135-137). Fail open: allow dispatch as before so this
  //     gate never regresses the reconcile-from-OSC path.
  //
  // The gate is a bounded WAIT across re-probes, not a single shot (issue #463).
  // The tick loop re-invokes this each tick, so we probe again on later ticks:
  //   - On success the record is stamped callbackTrustReady=true and persisted

  //   - A probe failure (tls-trust, connection, OR timeout) while still inside
  //     the bounded window is NOT quarantining — we return false (ineligible
  //     this tick) so a later tick re-probes. This lets the transient PKIX race
  //     (the ingress cert becomes trusted ~35s after spawn) resolve instead of
  //     permanently sidelining an instance on an early fast-fail PKIX error.
  //   - Only once the elapsed time since the FIRST probe exceeds the bounded
  //     deadline do we quarantine the instance and emit a structured error
  //     (instanceId + ingress hostname) rather than throw into the tick loop.
  //   - A 401/403 from the listener ingress is NOT a transport failure and is
  //     NOT "trusted" either (issue #813): the callback path is reachable but
  //     rejecting requests. Since #814 the probe asks about `/encoreCallback`
  //     itself rather than the bare ingress origin, so this branch now actually
  //     fires during the ~14s window after a fresh listener's ingress starts
  //     answering, in which the origin returns 200 while `/encoreCallback` is
  //     still auth-walled (measured live; see callback-trust-probe.ts header).
  //     That window is the #811/#812 failure, and it resolves on its own well
  //     inside the bounded wait — the instance is simply held ineligible until
  //     it does. Past the bounded wait it resolves to the degraded
  //     `callbackPathUnusableAt` state — persisted, logged, and dispatched to
