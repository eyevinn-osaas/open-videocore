// Principal identity + role resolution (ADR-018, issue #553).
//
// This is the RESOLUTION half of the authorisation model (ADR-018, issue #552):
// read the caller's role off a single trusted request header and attach a
// principal descriptor to the request. It performs NO enforcement — it never
// returns 403, never gates a route, and does not change any endpoint's
// behaviour. Enforcement (the fail-closed 403 on an unrecognised role, header
// stripping at the trust boundary, and the authorize() matrix) is deferred to
// issue #554 (ADR-018 decisions 2 and 5).
//
// Identity is stated honestly per the #551 spike and ADR-018: OSC provides no
// downstream per-request principal identity, so every authenticated caller is
// the same deployment-wide operator principal (`src/auth/workspace.ts:33-42`).
// We therefore do NOT fabricate a user id or store. The descriptor names that
// single operator principal and carries the resolved role so #529's audit log
// can consume a real principal shape instead of a coarse user/system/ai enum.
//
// Contract sources verified before writing (per CLAUDE.md rule 7):
//   - Role header + defaulting rules: ADR-018 decisions 1 & 5
//     (branch issue-552/authorisation-adr,
//     docs/architecture/ADR-018-authorisation-model.md).
//   - Request-decoration pattern mirrored: src/auth/middleware.ts:12-17.
//   - preHandler seam mirrored: src/main.ts:316-329 (x-stack-name resolution).
//   - Single-operator principal / presence-only gate: src/auth/workspace.ts:33-42.
