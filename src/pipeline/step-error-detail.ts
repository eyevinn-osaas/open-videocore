// Structured, machine-readable failure detail for a pipeline step (issue #1060).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A failed `transcode` step has, until now, carried exactly one piece of
// information: a free-text `error` string copied verbatim from the Encore job
// document's `message` field. For a source-read failure that string is
//
//   dropped by Encore: ffprobe failed for input s3://<bucket>/<key>:
//   Server returned 404 Not Found
//
// which tells a caller that something 404'd but not, in any machine-readable
// form, WHAT: they have to open the Encore job and then the bucket to discover
// that the source key is simply absent (#1060, broken out of #1057). This type
// is the structured half of that answer. It sits ALONGSIDE `error` — the free
// text is unchanged, so nothing that reads it today breaks — and carries the
// code, the redacted source location and the correlation ids as fields.
//
// CONTRACT SOURCES VERIFIED BEFORE WRITING (CLAUDE.md rule 7)
// -----------------------------------------------------------
//   - `StepExecution` is the step record this detail hangs off:
//     `{ name; status; jobId?; encoreJobId?; error?; skipReason?; startedAt?;
//        completedAt?; progress? }` — src/data/pipeline-repo.ts:43-56.
//   - The response contract it must appear in is `stepExecutionSchema`, declared
//     twice (deliberately duplicated in this codebase) at
//     src/routes/pipelines.ts:17-30 (GET /api/v1/pipelines[/:executionId]) and
//     src/routes/assets.ts:1134-1144 (POST /:id/execute, GET /:id/executions,
//     GET /:id/pipelines).
//   - The precedent for an ADDITIVE, OPTIONAL annotation on a step is
//     `skipReason` (#789, src/data/pipeline-repo.ts:50-53): a new optional field
//     that explains a status without changing the status enum. `errorDetail`
//     follows it exactly.
//
// The zod schema lives here next to the type so the two route copies of
// `stepExecutionSchema` share ONE definition and cannot drift (the surrounding
// step schema is duplicated for historical reasons; this part is not).

//
// `source_read_failed` (#1060): the step failed because the SOURCE object could
// not be read — the storage answered 404/403, or the connection to it failed.
// This is distinct from every other transcode failure (a bad profile, a codec
// error, a lost worker) because the remedy is different and is entirely about
// the input: the key is missing, or the credentials/permissions on it are wrong.
//
// Kept as a `const` tuple so the route schemas derive their enum from it and a
// new code cannot be added without the response contract following.

// here (see redactUrlsInText in ./encore-source-read-failure.ts): a source
// location can be a presigned URL whose query string carries a live SigV4
// signature, or carry userinfo, and this field is served to API callers.
//
// `bucket`/`key` are split out of that already-redacted `url` and never out of
// the raw location, so the three fields always agree and none of them can carry
// userinfo or a presigned query string.
//
// `bucket`/`key` are present when the location was an `s3://bucket/key` URI,
// which is what the transcode path always submits (`inputUri` =
// `s3://${sourceBucket}/${sourceObjectKey}`, src/pipeline/transcode.ts:140).

  // identifies the Encore job and the asset it belongs to.
