// URL-pull ingest worker (issue #5).
//
// Runs the asynchronous pull of a remote source into MinIO and keeps the
// IngestJob + Asset records in step. It is invoked in-process as a detached
// async task from the route (no separate worker process yet — a Valkey-backed
// queue is a future enhancement, see the OSC friction log). The worker is the
// single owner of a job's lifecycle once created:
//
//   pending --start--> running --(stream ok)--> done   (asset -> processing)
//                              \--(error)------> failed (asset -> failed)
//
// Because the worker owns the terminal transition, it also emits the job's
// TERMINAL audit entry (`job.completed` / `job.failed`, issue #1000) — the
// matching `job.submitted` is emitted by POST /ingest-url where the job record is
// created. Same actor/action/target shape the transcode and packaging pipelines
// use, so an ingest -> transcode -> package run reads as one contiguous trail
// instead of starting mid-pipeline.
//
// Resilience: transient pull failures are retried up to MAX_ATTEMPTS with
// exponential backoff. A SourceTooLargeError or SourceValidationError is
// permanent and fails the job immediately without retry. Progress events
// (% bytes) are persisted to the job as the stream advances, throttled so we do
// not write to CouchDB on every chunk. Every attempt starts from a clean slate:
// any multipart upload still open for the object key is discarded first, so a
// retry writes a fresh upload instead of resuming the dead one (issue #1088).
