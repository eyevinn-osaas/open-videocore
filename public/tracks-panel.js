/**
 * open-videocore ops dashboard — tracks-panel.js
 *
 * The "Tracks" block on the asset detail view (issue #902, broken out of #794):
 * one section per track kind — video, audio, subtitle — each listing only the
 * attributes the API actually exposes for that kind, and each with an explicit
 * empty state when the asset has none.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY DEFAULT, and write-capable only where it is asked to be. With
 * neither `audioEdit` nor `apiFetch` injected this module creates no form
 * control and issues no request — it is byte-for-byte the panel #902 shipped.
 * The two write capabilities are independent opt-ins, and they are owned in two
 * different places:
 *
 *   AUDIO add/remove (issue #903, broken out of #794) — mounted WITH
 *     `audioEdit`, the editorial audio group renders add/remove controls, but
 *     this module still writes nothing itself: it asks
 *     public/audio-track-edit.js for two nodes (a per-row control and the add
 *     block) and that module owns the calls, the confirmation step, the inline
 *     error and the refresh. Layout stays here; everything that writes stays
 *     there.
 *
 *   SUBTITLE add/remove (issue #940) — mounted WITH `apiFetch`, the subtitle
 *     section carries an add form and a per-row remove control, wired to
 *     `POST /assets/{id}/subtitle-tracks` and
 *     `DELETE /assets/{id}/subtitle-tracks/{trackId}` (contract below). These
 *     two calls ARE issued from this file.
 *
 * The VIDEO section is read-only under every mount: the API has no video-track
 * write route at all (checked — see "What the API does NOT expose" below).
 *
 * It issues no GET on the render path either way. Every value the panel paints
 * first comes from the `GET /assets/{id}` body the detail view already fetched,
 * so the panel adds no round-trip to the render; after a subtitle write it
 * re-renders from the write's OWN response body (the 201 carries the track the
 * server persisted), not from a guess and not from a second read.
 *
 * Every operator-visible string is written with `textContent` / `createElement`
 * — no server value ever reaches `innerHTML`, including a subtitle `format` or
 * a `language` this build does not recognise, which are rendered verbatim as
 * text rather than guessed at or dropped.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CONTRACT GROUNDING (CLAUDE.md rule 7 — fetched before any call was written)
 *
 * Read from this repo's generated spec and route source on this branch. Nothing
 * is taken from the issue text — in particular the issue names three endpoints
 * as sources and two of them have no GET at all (see "What the API does NOT
 * expose" below). `openapi.json` declares no `operationId` on any operation, so
 * operations are identified below by path + method, as the spec itself does.
 *
 *   EVERYTHING HERE COMES FROM ONE READ —
 *   `openapi.json .paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}"].get`, 200 schema. That body
 *   carries the editorial tracks AND the probe's technical metadata, so the
 *   panel needs no call of its own.
 *
 *   AUDIO + SUBTITLE (editorial) — properties `audioTracks` / `subtitleTracks`
 *     of that same 200 schema. NEITHER is in `required`:
 *       `audioTracks[]` items: `{ id: string, language: string, codec?: string,
 *         channels?: number, label?: string, default?: boolean }`,
 *         `required: ["id","language"]`, `additionalProperties: false`.
 *       `subtitleTracks[]` items: `{ id: string, language: string,
 *         format: "vtt"|"srt"|"ttml", objectKey?: string, label?: string,
 *         default?: boolean }`, `required: ["id","language","format"]`,
 *         `additionalProperties: false`.
 *     Source of truth: `assetSchema` —
 *       `audioTracks: z.array(audioTrackOutSchema).optional()`
 *       (src/routes/assets.ts:916) and
 *       `subtitleTracks: z.array(subtitleTrackOutSchema).optional()` (:917),
 *       `audioTrackOutSchema` :804-811, `subtitleTrackOutSchema` :815-822; the
 *       subtitle vocabulary is `SUBTITLE_FORMATS = ['vtt','srt','ttml']`,
 *       src/data/asset-repo.ts:449, reached via `subtitleFormatSchema`
 *       (src/routes/assets.ts:813).
 *     ABSENT MEANS "NONE", NOT "UNKNOWN". The field is optional because the
 *       arrays are "absent until the first track of the respective kind is
 *       added" (src/routes/assets.ts:914-915); persistence only writes the
 *       block when the array is non-empty (`doc.structural.editorialAudio` /
 *       `editorialSubtitles`, src/data/asset-document.ts:553-557) and reads it
 *       straight back (:693-694). So an omitted array is an empty one, and this
 *       panel renders the kind's empty state — never an "unknown" state.
 *
 *   VIDEO — property `technicalMetadata` of the same 200 schema (nullable
 *     object, NOT in `required`):
 *       `{ codec: string, width: number, height: number,
 *          durationSeconds: number, bitrateBps: number,
 *          containerFormat: string, audioTracks: […], extractedAt: string }`,
 *       all eight `required`, `additionalProperties: false`.
 *     Source of truth: `technicalMetadata: technicalMetadataSchema.nullish()`
 *       (src/routes/assets.ts:893) with `technicalMetadataError: z.string()
 *       .optional()` (:894); `technicalMetadataSchema` :761-771.
 *     Of those eight, exactly FOUR are video-track attributes:
 *       `codec`, `width`, `height`, `bitrateBps`. That is not a judgement call —
 *       it is the tuple the persistence layer writes into the document's video
 *       track array: `technical.video = [{ codec, width, height, bitrateBps }]`
 *       (`technicalFromAsset`, src/data/asset-document.ts:402-404), read back as
 *       `technical.video?.[0]` (`technicalToAsset`, :422). `durationSeconds` and
 *       `containerFormat` are CONTAINER-level (they map to `technical.durationMs`
 *       / `technical.container`, :400-401), so they are not shown as track
 *       attributes here; they already appear in the detail KV grid.
 *     Deliberately NOT rendered: `frameRate` and `index`. Both exist on the
 *       stored `VideoTrackSchema` (src/data/asset-document.ts:51-58) but NO
 *       response schema exposes them, so there is nothing to read.
 *
 *   AUDIO, AS PROBED — the nested `technicalMetadata.audioTracks[]` array:
 *     items `{ index: number, codec: string, channels: number,
 *     sampleRateHz: number }`, all four `required`,
 *     `additionalProperties: false` (`audioTrackSchema`,
 *     src/routes/assets.ts:754-759; persisted as `technical.audio`,
 *     src/data/asset-document.ts:405-410).
 *     This is a DIFFERENT set of objects from the editorial `audioTracks` at the
 *     top level of the asset: different fields, different lifecycle (one is
 *     written by the ffprobe extraction, the other by an operator), no shared
 *     id. They share only a name. The audio section therefore lists them as two
 *     labelled groups and never merges, correlates, de-duplicates or SUMS them —
 *     the API publishes no key that would justify any of that, so each group
 *     carries its own count and the `Audio` heading carries none.
 *
 *   AUDIO, ADD + REMOVE (issue #903) — `POST /api/v1/assets/{id}/audio-tracks`
 *     (201 → the full updated `{ audioTracks }`) and
 *     `DELETE /api/v1/assets/{id}/audio-tracks/{trackId}` (204, empty body).
 *     Both operate on the EDITORIAL list only. The full request/response
 *     contract for them — bodies, bounds, both 404 shapes, and the post-remove
 *     re-read — is cited in public/audio-track-edit.js, which owns those calls.
 *     Nothing in this file issues them.
 *     Anchors on this branch: `addAudioTrackSchema` src/routes/assets.ts:907-913,
 *     routes :6462-6492 (POST) and :6497-6519 (DELETE).
 *
 *   SUBTITLE ADD (issue #940) — `openapi.json
 *     .paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}/subtitle-tracks"].post`. The ONLY key on that
 *     path object is `post`; there is no GET (see "What the API does NOT
 *     expose").
 *     parameters: exactly one — path `id` (string, required). NO query params.
 *     requestBody: `required: true`, `application/json`,
 *       `additionalProperties: false`, `required: ["language","format"]`:
 *         `language` string, minLength 1, maxLength 64
 *         `format`   string, enum ["vtt","srt","ttml"]
 *         `label`    string, minLength 1, maxLength 128   (optional)
 *         `default`  boolean                              (optional)
 *       So exactly TWO fields are required and the form asks for exactly those
 *       two plus the two optional ones — nothing else may be sent, because
 *       `additionalProperties: false` makes an extra key a 400.
 *     Source of truth: `addSubtitleTrackSchema`, src/routes/assets.ts:915-920,
 *       wired as `body: addSubtitleTrackSchema` at :6533 on
 *       `app.post('/:id/subtitle-tracks', …)` :6527-6569. The format vocabulary
 *       is `subtitleFormatSchema = z.enum(SUBTITLE_FORMATS)` (:894) over
 *       `SUBTITLE_FORMATS = ['vtt','srt','ttml']` (src/data/asset-repo.ts) —
 *       the SAME constant the read path renders, so the select cannot offer a
 *       value the response schema would refuse.
 *     responses: exactly `201` and `404` are DECLARED (:6534-6537).
 *       201: `{ track: <subtitleTrackOutSchema>, uploadUrl?: string }`,
 *            `required: ["track"]`, `additionalProperties: false`.
 *            `track` is the SAME item schema the read path renders, and it is
 *            literally the object the handler persisted — built at :6555-6564,
 *            written by `repo.update(asset.id, { subtitleTracks })` at :6566,
 *            then sent at :6567. So appending it to the on-screen list shows
 *            what the server stored; it is the server's answer, not an
 *            optimistic patch.
 *       404: `{ error: string, message?: string }` — unknown/foreign asset
 *            (:6542-6544, `errorSchema` :560).
 *       400 is NOT declared but IS reachable: a body that fails
 *            `addSubtitleTrackSchema` is a Fastify validation error, and the
 *            router's `setErrorHandler` rethrows anything it does not classify,
 *            so Fastify's default handler answers 400. Asserted in the API's own
 *            suite — `format: 'sub'` → 400, test/tracks.test.ts:349-358.
 *            Surfaced inline verbatim.
 *       `uploadUrl` is a presigned PUT for the subtitle FILE
 *            (`storageFor().presignedPut(objectKey)`, :6552), returned only when
 *            object storage is configured. The track is created either way
 *            (:6561 — `objectKey` is recorded only when storage exists).
 *            Adding a track therefore REGISTERS it; it does not upload a
 *            subtitle file. The panel says so and deliberately does NOT print
 *            the signed URL into the DOM — it is a short-lived credential, and
 *            the object key it points at is already in the table.
 *
 *   SUBTITLE REMOVE (issue #940) — `openapi.json
 *     .paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}/subtitle-tracks/{trackId}"].delete`. The ONLY
 *     key on that path object is `delete`.
 *     parameters: exactly two path params, `id` and `trackId`, both string +
 *       required. NO query params — there is no `?force=` on this operation.
 *     requestBody: NONE.
 *     responses: exactly `204` (null) and `404` `{ error, message? }`.
 *     Source of truth: `app.delete('/:id/subtitle-tracks/:trackId', …)`,
 *       src/routes/assets.ts:6575-6597; params :6580, response map :6581.
 *     The 404 covers BOTH "unknown/foreign asset" (:6586-6588) and "no track
 *       with that id" (:6591-6593). The panel does not try to tell those apart:
 *       under either one the server does not have this track, so dropping the
 *       row is correct for both.
 *     This removes the TRACK RECORD only. The handler filters the array and
 *       updates the document (:6589-6594); the subtitle object in storage is
 *       left behind on purpose — "Leaves the subtitle object (if any) in
 *       storage; storage reclamation is a separate lifecycle concern" (:6571).
 *       The confirmation dialog states exactly that, both sides.
 *
 *   AUTHORISATION for both writes — the ADR-018 role×action matrix `MATRIX`
 *     (src/auth/authorize.ts:54-58: `viewer { read: true, write: false,
 *     delete: false }`, editor/admin all true) applied by
 *     `resourceAuthorizationPreHandler('asset')` (src/auth/authorize.ts:126,
 *     registered src/routes/assets.ts:1938), with the action from
 *     `methodToAction` (:79-93): POST → `write`, DELETE → `delete`. A `viewer`
 *     holds neither, so both controls are withheld for that role and the 403
 *     (`AUTHZ_FORBIDDEN_ERROR = 'forbidden_insufficient_role'`,
 *     src/auth/authorize.ts:99) is still handled when it arrives — the server is
 *     the authority, the client gate is only a mirror.
 *
 *   NOT offered, because the contract does not support it: editing a track in
 *     place. There is no PATCH/PUT on either track path, so "change the label"
 *     is add + remove, and this panel does not dress those two calls up as one
 *     edit. Nor is `default` exclusive: the add handler stores the flag as given
 *     and never clears it on the other tracks (:6555-6564), so two tracks CAN
 *     both read Default. The form says so rather than implying a radio group.
 *
 * WHAT THE API DOES NOT EXPOSE (checked, not assumed):
 *   - There is no GET on `/api/v1/assets/{id}/audio-tracks` or
 *     `…/subtitle-tracks`. In `openapi.json` those paths carry only `post`, and
 *     `…/{trackId}` only `delete` (src/routes/assets.ts:6463, 6498, 6528, 6576).
 *   - There is no UPDATE of any kind on a track: no PUT and no PATCH on either
 *     track path. A track's language, codec, channels, label or default flag
 *     cannot be edited in place, so this panel offers add and remove only —
 *     changing a track means removing it and adding a new one, which mints a
 *     new id.
 *   - There is no add/remove route for VIDEO tracks at all (no path in
 *     `openapi.json` contains "video"), so the video section stays read-only.
 *   - `GET /api/v1/assets/{id}/tracks` DOES exist and is the only *dedicated*
 *     read for the two editorial kinds — but it is not a second source of truth:
 *     its handler sends `asset.audioTracks ?? []` / `asset.subtitleTracks ?? []`
 *     from the very same document (src/routes/assets.ts:6453-6454, via
 *     `repo.get(request.params.id)` at :6447). A caller that already holds the
 *     asset — which the detail view always does — would be paying a round-trip
 *     for bytes it has, so this panel does not call it on the render path or
 *     after a subtitle write: the 201 already carries the persisted track and
 *     the 204 already means "gone", so a re-read would buy nothing. (The audio
 *     editor does call it, but only after a 204 from a remove, which carries no
 *     body — see public/audio-track-edit.js.)
 *   - There is no video-track WRITE endpoint: no path in `openapi.json` contains
 *     "video". `GET /assets/{id}/tracks` now does project a `videoTracks[]`
 *     array (issue #978, `videoTracksOf` at src/routes/assets.ts:6452, items
 *     `{ index?, codec, width, height, bitrateBps?, frameRate? }`) — but that is
 *     on the dedicated tracks read, NOT on the `GET /assets/{id}` body this
 *     panel renders from, whose only video attributes are the flattened
 *     `technicalMetadata` set. So this panel still lists at most one video track
 *     per asset, however many the source file holds. That ceiling is the API
 *     body's, not this module's, and the section says so on screen rather than
 *     implying the file has exactly one video stream.

 * Render the "Tracks" block into the asset detail view.
 *
 * The RENDER is synchronous and network-free: all four record sets — the video
 * attributes, the editorial audio and subtitle tracks, and the probed source
 * streams — are properties of the `GET /assets/{id}` body the caller already
 * holds, so the panel neither re-reads the asset nor calls
 * `GET /assets/{id}/tracks` for bytes it was handed (see CONTRACT GROUNDING).
 * It adds no round-trip to the detail render, and there is no "tracks
 * unavailable" state: an absent array is a known-empty kind, not a failed read.
 * That holds whether or not `audioEdit` / `apiFetch` are passed — neither the
 * audio editor nor the subtitle controls issue a request until an operator
 * activates one of them.
 *
 * It DOES call on operator action, once #940's controls are enabled: one POST
 * per add, one DELETE per remove, and nothing else — no re-read afterwards,
 * because the 201 carries the persisted track and the 204 means it is gone.
 *
 * SUBTITLE WRITES ARE OPT-IN. They are wired only when `apiFetch` and `assetId`
 * are both supplied. Without them this returns exactly what #902 returned:
 * a read-only block with no controls and no listeners.

 *                                      so this must be `asset.id` even when the
