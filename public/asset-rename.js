/**
 * open-videocore ops dashboard — asset-rename.js
 *
 * The "Rename" action (issues #956, #927): an operator-facing affordance for the
 * `name` field that PATCH /api/v1/assets/{id} has always accepted but that no
 * control in this UI could ever trigger.
 *
 * TWO surfaces offer it, ONE implementation behind them:
 *   - the asset DETAIL view's action row — `mountAssetRename` (issue #956);
 *   - a per-row control in the assets LIST — the "inline-in-list" affordance from
 *     issue #927, which calls `openRenameDialog` straight from the table's
 *     Actions cell (wired in public/app.js, rendered by public/assets-table.js).
 * Both go through `openRenameDialog`, so validation, the wire body, the copy and
 * the error handling cannot drift between where an operator happens to start.
 *
 * This module is now an ADAPTER over the shared rename affordance in
 * `public/rename-dialog.js` (extracted for issue #928, when collections needed
 * the same control). All of the behaviour — validation against the server
 * bounds, the body construction, the error classification, the dialog markup and
 * the mount — lives there and is shared; this file supplies the asset copy deck
 * and the asset path, and keeps this module's existing exports stable for its
 * callers (public/app.js) and its test suite.
 *
 * UI ONLY. No route, schema or response shape is changed by this module; it
 * sends the one field the existing PATCH body already declares.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CONTRACT GROUNDING (CLAUDE.md rule 7 — fetched before any call was written)
 *
 * Read from this repo's route source and generated spec. Nothing is taken from
 * the issue text.
 *
 *   The write — `openapi.json .paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}"].patch`
 *     parameters: exactly one — path `id` (string, required). No query params.
 *     requestBody schema properties: `name` (string, minLength 1, maxLength 256),
 *       `description`, `objectKey`, `status`, `metadata`, `tags`;
 *       `additionalProperties: false`. Every property optional.
 *     responses: exactly `200` (the FULL asset — the same schema as
 *       GET /api/v1/assets/{id}), `404` and `422`.
 *     Source of truth: `updateSchema`, src/routes/assets.ts:409-419 —
 *       `name: z.string().min(1).max(256).optional()` at :411, with
 *       `.refine((b) => Object.keys(b).length > 0)` at :419 (so a body must
 *       carry at least one field); wired at `app.patch('/:id', …)`
 *       src/routes/assets.ts:5532-5541, `response: { 200: assetSchema,
 *       404: errorSchema, 422: errorSchema }` at :5539.
 *     A body that violates the schema (empty or over-long `name`) is rejected by
 *       fastify-type-provider-zod with a 400 in Fastify's own validation
 *       envelope BEFORE the handler runs — 400 is not declared on this
 *       operation, so nothing here assumes a modelled body for it. The dialog
 *       validates client-side first so that 400 is not the normal way an
 *       operator learns the rule.
 *
 *   What `name` IS — `openapi.json …get.responses["200"] … properties.name`:
 *     "Canonical editorial title of the asset. … this is the single documented
 *     location for title across GET, list, and search responses. There is no
 *     separate top-level `title` field." So renaming through this one field is
 *     what makes the new name appear in the asset list (GET /api/v1/assets/) and
 *     in search results (GET /api/v1/search/) — both project the same field, and
 *     both are served from the live asset documents (InMemorySearchRepository
 *     reads `assets.list()`, src/data/inmemory-search-repo.ts:38;
 *     CouchSearchRepository reads the partition with `couch.find`,
 *     src/data/couch-search-repo.ts:50-56). There is no separately-maintained
 *     name index that could go stale after a rename.
 *
 *   What a rename does NOT touch (issue #956 AC2, verified in the repository
 *   layer rather than assumed):
 *     - `slug` — minted ONCE at creation by `generateUniqueSlug`
 *       (src/data/asset-repo.ts:1424, inside `create`). Neither update path
 *       assigns `slug`: `InMemoryAssetRepository.update`
 *       (src/data/asset-repo.ts:1620-1701) and `CouchAssetRepository.applyPatch`
 *       (src/data/couch-asset-repo.ts:376-447) copy the existing asset and then
 *       assign ONLY the keys present on the patch — `if (patch.name !== undefined)
 *       next.name = patch.name;` (asset-repo.ts:1631 / couch-asset-repo.ts:379).
 *       No `slug` derivation appears in either function.
 *     - `id` — the ULID is the store key on both paths and is never rewritten.
 *     - stored object keys — `objectKey` changes only when the patch itself
 *       carries one (asset-repo.ts:1633 / couch-asset-repo.ts:381), and the key
 *       is derived from the ASSET ID, never from the name:
 *       `sourceObjectKey(assetId) => \`sources/${assetId}\``
 *       (src/routes/asset-upload.ts:96-98). This module therefore sends `name`
 *       and nothing else — `renameRequestBody` (now shared, rename-dialog.js) is
 *       the single place the body is built, so no sibling field can be sent by
 *       accident.
 *
 *   Authorisation — `MATRIX` (src/auth/authorize.ts:54-58) grants `write` to
 *     `editor` and `admin` only; `methodToAction` (:79-93) maps PATCH -> write;
 *     `resourceAuthorizationPreHandler('asset')` (:126, registered
 *     src/routes/assets.ts:1718) applies it to this route. So a `viewer` gets a
 *     403 `forbidden_insufficient_role` (:99). The caller passes `canChange` as
 *     a client-side MIRROR of that rule; the 403 path still runs, because the
 *     server is the authority.
 *
 *   Path parameter — `app.patch('/:id')` passes the raw param straight to
 *     `repo.update` (src/routes/assets.ts:5551), which looks the document up by
 *     id (`this.store.get(key)` asset-repo.ts:1625 / `couch.get(id)`
 *     couch-asset-repo.ts:346). Unlike GET /:id there is NO slug fallback, so
 *     this module always sends the ULID (`asset.id`), which the detail pane
 *     holds even when it was opened by slug.
