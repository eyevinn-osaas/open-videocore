/**
 * open-videocore ops dashboard — assets-table.js
 *
 * Issue #369: sort, filter, and pagination for the ops-UI assets table.
 *
 * This module wires the EXISTING assets table onto the two already-merged shared
 * primitives — it reinvents none of the table/sort/filter/URL machinery:
 *   - public/ops-ui-table.js      (#367/#372) — the table component + state hook.
 *   - public/table-url-state.js   (#368/#373) — the URL query-param contract.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CONTRACT GROUNDING (fetch-the-contract-before-writing-any-call rule)
 *
 * Every query param, field, and status value below is verified against the live
 * OpenAPI schema in this repo (openapi.json) and the route source, NOT guessed.
 *
 * Tier 1 — exact/range list (no free-text term), per ADR-005:
 *   Endpoint: GET /api/v1/assets/  (openapi.json path key "/api/v1/assets/").
 *   Verified query params (openapi.json
 *   .paths["/api/v1/assets/"].get.parameters and `listQuerySchema`,
 *   src/routes/assets.ts:373):
 *     limit    integer 1..200
 *     offset   integer >=0
 *     status   enum ['uploading','processing','ready','failed','archived']
 *     parentId string
 *     from     string, created-at lower bound (inclusive)
 *     to       string, created-at upper bound (inclusive)
 *   Response envelope (listSchema, top-level props): { items, limit, offset, total }.
 *   Item fields used here (verified present in the list item schema): id, slug,
 *   name (canonical title), status, tags, thumbnails, createdAt,
 *   technicalMetadataError, deleteLock.
 *   `deleteLock` (issue #894) is
 *   openapi.json .paths["/api/v1/assets/"].get.responses["200"]
 *   .content["application/json"].schema.properties.items.items.properties
 *   .deleteLock — an object { locked, reason?, lockedAt, lockedBy? } with
 *   required ["locked","lockedAt"] and additionalProperties:false
 *   (`deleteLockSchema`, src/routes/assets.ts:528; `DeleteLock`,
 *   src/data/asset-repo.ts:441). Only `locked` is read here; the derivation
 *   lives in public/lock-state.js.
 *   Ordering: the server ALWAYS returns createdAt-ascending with a ULID `id`
 *   tie-break (src/data/asset-repo.ts:937 — `createdAt.localeCompare … || id…`),
 *   i.e. ULID `_id` creation order per ADR-005. There is NO server `sort` or `q`
 *   param on this endpoint (confirmed absent from the schema).
 *
 * Tier 2 — free-text FTS (a `q` term is present), per ADR-005:
 *   Endpoint: GET /api/v1/search/  (the CANONICAL free-text path already used by
 *   the Search tab in app.js — we reuse it rather than adding a second search
 *   path, per the issue's explicit constraint).
 *   Verified query params (openapi.json .paths["/api/v1/search/"].get.parameters
 *   and `searchQuerySchema`, src/routes/search.ts:146): q (string 1..512),
 *   status (the SAME status enum as tier 1), from, to, page (int >=1),
 *   pageSize (int 1..100), plus tags/mimeType/tams* (unused here).
 *   Response envelope (searchResultSchema, src/routes/search.ts:118-131):
 *     { assets, collections, total, collectionTotal, page }. `total` is the count
 *     of matching ASSETS; `collectionTotal` counts collection hits separately and
 *     this table (assets only) ignores it.
 *
 * TAG + METADATA FILTERS (issue #914). The filter bar also narrows by tag and by
 * free-form operator metadata. Both are filters ONLY `GET /api/v1/search/` has —
 * `GET /api/v1/assets/` declares neither (verified: openapi.json
 * .paths["/api/v1/assets/"].get.parameters is limit/offset/status/parentId/from/to
 * only, and `listQuerySchema`, src/routes/assets.ts:373) — so setting either one
 * routes the request to the tier-2 search endpoint even with NO free-text term.
 * That is sound, not a workaround: `q` is `.optional()` on `searchQuerySchema`
 * (src/routes/search.ts:155-166), so a tags-only or metadata-only search is a
 * first-class query, and every filter is applied to the whole matched set before
 * the page slice, so the reported `total` stays exact (#834) on this tier too.
 *   tags      — `?tags=` accepts a repeated param OR one comma-separated list and
 *               normalises to a trimmed, non-empty array (`tagsSchema`,
 *               src/routes/search.ts:139-150). The control therefore sends the
 *               operator's comma-separated text as a single `tags` param, which is
 *               the SAME shape the Search tab sends (app.js renderSearchTab:
 *               `params.set('tags', tags)`).
 *   metadata  — one `metadata.<key>=<value>` param per pair (issue #12;
 *               `extractMetadataFilter`, src/routes/search.ts:221-240, which pulls
 *               the dynamic keys out of the `.passthrough()` querystring at
 *               src/routes/search.ts:218). Because the key names are dynamic they
 *               appear in no OpenAPI `parameters` list — the route source IS the
 *               contract for them.
 * Container/MIME (`mimeType`) is deliberately NOT offered here (issue #822 owns
 * that vocabulary; explicitly out of scope for #914), even though the param exists.
 *
 * `status` / `from` / `to` ARE SERVER-SIDE ON BOTH TIERS (issue #833, merged).
 * Both endpoints share ONE definition of the created-at range grammar and match
 * semantics — `CreatedFromSchema`/`CreatedToSchema`/`resolveCreatedRange` in
 * src/data/created-range.ts — so the two surfaces cannot drift. Each bound
 * accepts either `YYYY-MM-DD` (what the `<input type="date">` controls below
 * emit) or a full ISO instant, and BOTH bounds are inclusive: a bare `to` date
 * is expanded server-side to that UTC day's last instant, so the client must NOT
 * do its own end-of-day arithmetic. Every filter is applied to the WHOLE matched
 * set before the page slice, so the reported `total` already counts exactly the
 * filtered rows (src/data/asset-repo.ts:1502-1508 for the list tier,
 * src/data/search-repo.ts:49-54 for the FTS tier). We therefore pass the filters
 * through and report the backend's `total` verbatim — no client-side narrowing
 * (issue #834). An inverted range (`from` > `to`) is a 400
 * `invalid_created_range` from both routes, surfaced as a normal table error.
 *
 * TIER-2 PROJECTION GAP (delete-lock, issue #894). The search projection
 * (`assetSchema`, src/routes/search.ts:78 — Fastify serializes against it) has NO
 * `deleteLock` property, so a locked asset carries no lock field while a
 * free-text `q` is active. That is lock state UNKNOWN, not unlocked, and the
 * difference matters: rendering "unlocked" there would be a promise the payload
 * does not support. The table therefore shows no lock flag on tier-2 rows and
 * makes no counter-claim either (there is no "Unlocked" badge to contradict),
 * and the Archive control is left alone so the 409 `delete_protected` path stays
 * the authority. Tracked as gap H1 in docs/ux/asset-lock-state-spec.md §9; the
 * fix is a server-side one — add `deleteLock` to the search projection.
 *
 * KNOWN CONTRACT GAP — one left, and it is an ORDERING gap only. (The previous
 * revision of this header pointed at a friction log in the separate
 * eng-open-videocore-agents repo; no such file exists in either repo, so the gap
 * is documented here instead of behind a dangling pointer.)
 *   1. Neither endpoint accepts a server-side `sort` param; the list endpoint is
 *      fixed to createdAt-ascending. So created-date DESC and the status/title
 *      sorts are applied to the CURRENT PAGE client-side. Created-date ASC is the
 *      native server order (true ULID creation-order paging, no client sort).
 *      This is a page-scoped ORDERING refinement only — it never drops a row, so
 *      it does not affect `total` or which rows paging reaches.
 *
 * FILTER-BOX INTERACTION (issue #946). The free-text box is a FILTER, not a
 * query form: it narrows the list as you type. It fires on a ~300ms trailing
 * debounce, so one search term costs one request rather than one per keystroke,
 * and it carries its own clear control plus a magnifier affordance so the box
 * looks like the thing it is. Emptying it — by deleting the text or by pressing
 * the clear control — dispatches immediately and unconditionally: "show me
 * everything" is the cheap tier-1 list call and should never wait on a timer or
 * on a minimum term length. Enter is a shortcut that flushes a debounce still in
 * flight, never a requirement. See searchFilterControl() below.
 *
 * COLUMN VISIBILITY (issue #959). The operator chooses which of the eight declared
 * columns are rendered. This is VIEW state and touches NO part of the request: the
 * two tiers above, their params, the client sort and the paging window are all
 * computed from `snap.sort` / `snap.filters` / `snap.offset`, none of which the
 * chooser writes. Hiding the Created column does not stop the table sorting by
 * createdAt, and hiding Status does not drop the `status` param — so `total` and
 * which rows a page reaches are unchanged by definition, not by convention.
 * Resolution order on load is URL -> stored per-operator default -> all columns;
 * see resolveInitialColumns() below. The chooser's "Reset to defaults" (issue
 * #962) unwinds that same ladder from the top: it clears the `assets.cols` param
 * AND this browser's stored default, so the table falls back to the declared set
 * and stays there on refresh and on the next visit alike.
 *
 * ROW RENAME (issue #927). The Actions column carries a Rename control, so an
 * operator renames an asset from the list without opening the detail pane. The
 * only write it can make is the one the detail view already made:
 *   PATCH /api/v1/assets/{id} — path param `id` only; request body properties
 *   `name` (string, minLength 1, maxLength 256), `description`, `objectKey`,
 *   `status`, `metadata`, `tags`, all optional, `additionalProperties: false`;
 *   responses 200 (the full asset) / 404 / 422. Verified in openapi.json
 *   .paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}"].patch and in `updateSchema`
 *   (src/routes/assets.ts:418, `name` at :420) wired at `app.patch('/:id', …)`
 *   (src/routes/assets.ts:5682). NO schema change was needed for this control.
 * The dialog, the validation and the body construction are NOT reimplemented
 * here: the row hands off to openRenameDialog (public/asset-rename.js), the same
 * entry point the detail view uses, which sends exactly `{ name }`. This module
 * contributes the button and the reload; see the Actions column renderer.
 *
 * SECURITY: mirrors app.js's XSS posture. Every dynamic value written into a cell
 * HTML string passes through escHtml() (imported from the shared primitive).

//
// Fill in the src of every thumbnail <img> on the page of rows just rendered.
// The cell renderer above cannot do this itself: it returns a synchronous HTML
// string, while obtaining a loadable URL needs an authenticated round-trip to
// GET /assets/:id/thumbnails/:index/url (contract in public/thumbnail-url.js).
//
// Cost is bounded by the page size — at most one request per visible row that
// actually has a thumbnail, issued once per render, never per repaint (a second
// request follows only for a row whose signed URL could not be issued or loaded,
// which then falls back to the authenticated byte route). Failures are silent by
// design: the row keeps its placeholder box (applyThumbnail re-applies
// `thumb-placeholder`) rather than turning a storage hiccup into a table-wide
// error. A response that arrives after the rows were replaced lands on a
// detached element and is discarded with it.
