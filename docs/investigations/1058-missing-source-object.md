# 1058 — Why `ingest/<assetId>` is missing from `openvideocore-source` when the transcoder reads it

**Date:** 2026-10-02
**Author:** surface-backend-api agent
**Type:** root-cause analysis + the fix that closes it (see "The fix")
**Code pinned to:** `d5a8200` — every `file:line` reference below is read against that
commit (the base this investigation branched from). The fix commit on this branch
moves some of those lines; the references are deliberately NOT re-pointed, so the
evidence stays verifiable against the code as it was when the bug was reported.
**Related:** #615 (per-request stack keying of the transcode path), #639 (per-stack source bucket), #804 (fail-loud endpoint resolution), #991 (in-cluster object-store endpoint), #616 (submit-time reachability preflight)
**Spun out of this analysis:** #1088 (resumed-multipart part-number off-by-one), #1089 (shared object-store root credential — security), #1090 (background work still resolves the default stack)

## Summary

The object is **not missing**. It is written, committed, and still present — in the
**wrong object-storage instance** relative to the one the transcoder is pointed at.

On an installation with two provisioned stacks, this API's **data plane**
(asset/job documents *and* object bytes) is wired to the **default stack — the
first name returned by the parameter store's stack listing** and ignores the
`X-Stack-Name` request header, while the **transcode control plane** (the Encore
auto-scaler pool, its Valkey queue, and the `s3Endpoint` each spawned transcoder
is created with) is keyed by the **header-named stack** (issue #615). When those
two stacks are not the same stack, the source object is written to instance A and
read from instance B.

Both instances hold a bucket with the **same name** — `openvideocore-source` is a
hard-coded literal applied to every provisioned stack
(`src/routes/provision.ts:59`, created at `:902`) — so nothing in the failing
`s3://openvideocore-source/ingest/<assetId>` URI, in the transcoder's error, or
in the submit-time preflight distinguishes "wrong instance" from "missing
object". The failure presents as ffprobe 404 / `NoSuchKey`.

This is size-independent. The 449 MB file is a **confounded** variable: the
reported working case is a *different stack* that also happens to use small
clips. See point 3 for the positive evidence that multipart handling is not
involved.

**Reproduced end to end** on a two-stack install (#1058 comment, 2026-10-02
12:26–12:39 UTC): stacks `['mcdev7','mcdev7b']`, every request carrying
`X-Stack-Name: mcdev7b`. The ingest wrote to `mcdev7`, the transcoder read
`mcdev7b`, and the failure text was byte-for-byte the customer's.

**The impact is wider than transcode.** The same divergence is visible on
`GET /api/v1/assets/{id}/files` — a *delivery* surface. In the reproduction the
presigned source URL named `mcdev7` under **either** header value, because the
URL is minted from `storageFor()` (the default stack) while the asset was
ingested under a header naming the other stack. Any download or playback URL
handed out for a non-first-stack asset therefore pointed at the wrong object
store, with no transcoder involved. Same root cause, separate blast radius.

## Point 1 — which endpoint and bucket each of the three paths uses

### Write path (URL-pull worker) → the DEFAULT stack

`POST /api/v1/assets/ingest-url` creates the asset, fixes the key as
`ingest/<assetId>`, and hands the worker a storage handle from the
**sync `storageFor()` factory**:

- `src/routes/assets.ts:2885-2886` — `const objectKey = \`ingest/${asset.id}\`` and
  `repo.update(asset.id, { objectKey })`.
- `src/routes/assets.ts:2899-2901` — `void runner({ jobId, assetId, objectKey, sourceUrl }, { … storage: storageFor() … })`.
- `src/pipeline/url-pull-worker.ts:119` — the worker's only write:
  `deps.storage.putStream(objectKey, …)`.

`storageFor()` is defined in the entrypoint and resolves the stack **with no
stack name**:

```ts
const storageFor: StorageFactory = (): WorkspaceStorage => {
  const conns = stackResolver.resolveCached();      // <-- no stack name
  if (!conns?.storageFor) { throw new Error('object storage is not configured for this stack'); }
  return conns.storageFor();
};
```
— `src/main.ts:658-664`.

`resolveCached(stackName?)` keys its cache by `stackName ?? ''`
(`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:1072-1077`), and the `''` entry is the one
`resolve()` builds when **no** name is given, which selects
`listStackNamesWithMigration(ps)[0]` — the first listed stack
(`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:874-886`, cache write at `:964-969`,
`cacheKey` at `:807`).

That `''` entry is guaranteed warm **inside the very same request**, not by luck:
the assets router's repository is `PerWorkspaceAssetRepository`, whose every call
is `(await this.resolver.resolve()).assets` — again **no stack name**
(`src/data/per-workspace-repos.ts:77`; the job, search, profile, pipeline,
collection and audit wrappers are identical, `:148`, `:188`, `:235-247`, `:258`,
`:265`, `:281`, `:306`, `:342`). `repo.create()` at `src/routes/assets.ts:2880`
therefore resolves and caches the default stack before `storageFor()` is called
at `:2901`.

So: **bytes and documents both land on the first-listed stack's MinIO/CouchDB,
whatever `X-Stack-Name` said.** The bucket is that stack's
`StackConfig.sourceBucket` (`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:213-214`, client
built from `config.minioEndpoint` at `:190-198`).

### Metadata-extraction read path → the DEFAULT stack (which is why it succeeds)

Extraction is handed the same factory's handle:

- `src/routes/assets.ts:1822-1840` — `triggerExtraction()` → `storage: storageFor()`.
- Called for URL-pull at `src/routes/assets.ts:2902-2907`, only once the pull
  settled the asset into `processing`.
- The probe reads a presigned GET minted from that handle
  (`src/pipeline/metadata-extractor.ts:10-16, 24-32`;
  `WorkspaceStorage.presignedGet`, `src/data/storage.ts:132-134`).

Because the write and this read go through the *same* `storageFor()` (default
stack), **successful metadata extraction proves the object exists — on the
default stack's instance.** It says nothing about the instance the transcoder
will use. This is exactly why the reported sequence is "pull done ✔, metadata ✔,
transcode 404".

### Transcoder read path → the HEADER-NAMED stack

Two independent inputs decide what the transcoder reads:

**Bucket name** comes from the per-request connections — i.e. the header-named
stack:

- `src/main.ts:461-473` — the global preHandler sets
  `request.connections = await stackResolver.resolve(stackName)` from
  `x-stack-name`.
- `src/routes/assets.ts:4448` — `sourceBucket: request.connections?.sourceBucket ?? opts.sourceBucket`
  (same at `:2523` for the pipeline path).
- `src/pipeline/transcode.ts:120` — `const inputUri = \`s3://${params.sourceBucket}/${params.sourceObjectKey}\``.

**Endpoint and credentials** come from the scaler, keyed by the header-named
stack:

- `src/routes/assets.ts:4433` — `workspaceId: await transcodeContext(request)`.
- `src/routes/assets.ts:1775-1781` — `transcodeContext()` reads `x-stack-name`
  and returns `opts.resolveStackContext(requested)`.
- `src/main.ts:1871-1872` — that option is
  `stackResolver.resolveStackName(requestedStackName)`, which returns the
  requested name **verbatim** whenever it has a stored config
  (`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:998-1012`).
- That value is the `contextId` of `encodeEncoreJobId` and therefore the scaler's
  partition key (`src/pipeline/transcode.ts:116`), which is fed to
  `resolveS3Config(stackKey)` — `src/main.ts:1151-1176`.
- `src/services/encore-s3-config.ts:196-237` — loads *that* stack's config and
  returns `{ endpoint: <that stack's minioEndpoint, mapped>, accessKeyId: 'admin',
  secretAccessKey }`.
- `src/encore-scaler/instance-pool.ts:367-372` — those become the Encore
  instance's `s3Endpoint` / `s3AccessKeyId` / `s3SecretAccessKey`.

**The mismatch, stated exactly:** the object key and the bucket *name* agree
across all three paths; the **endpoint** does not. Write/probe use
`resolve()`/`resolveCached()` with no name (first-listed stack); the transcoder
uses `resolveStackName(X-Stack-Name)` (named stack). With two MinIO instances
both exposing `openvideocore-source`, the result is a clean `NoSuchKey`.

### Why nothing catches it today

Three separate guards all pass:

1. The submit-time reachability preflight probes the named stack's storage but
   only does a **bucket** HEAD: `bucketExists(bucket)`
   (`src/services/stack-reachability.ts:100-104`, invoked at `:216`; call site
   `src/routes/assets.ts:4408-4425` passing
   `request.connections.s3Config.endpoint` + `request.connections.storageClient`).
   The bucket exists on *both* instances, so the probe is green.
2. `resolveEncoreS3Config` is fail-loud about an *unresolvable* endpoint (#804)
   but has no notion of "resolvable, but not the instance the bytes are in". Its
   `names[0]` fallback (`src/services/encore-s3-config.ts:199-204`) is a second,
   independent way to reach the wrong instance when the requested stack has no
   stored config.
3. Credentials are process-global — `accessKeyId: 'admin'`
   (`src/services/encore-s3-config.ts:80, 235`) plus one env secret — and the
   API's own per-stack client uses the same single `minioPassword`
   (`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:192-198`,
   `WorkspaceStackResolver` constructor `:724-756`). So if both instances share
   that root password, a cross-instance read **authenticates successfully** and
   returns `NoSuchKey` rather than a 403 that would have named the problem. The
   blast radius of one shared root credential across every stack is a security
   concern in its own right, filed as **#1089**.

## Point 2 — lifecycle / expiry / cleanup / move-after-extract

**Nothing in this codebase removes or relocates `ingest/<assetId>` on the path
between a successful pull and a transcode read.** Audited exhaustively:

- **No lifecycle or expiry rule is ever configured.** `setBucketLifecycle`,
  `Expiration` and `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` appear nowhere in `src/`
  (grep, 2026-10-02). The provision route creates buckets
  (`src/routes/provision.ts:902`) and sets an anonymous-read policy on the
  packaged bucket only; it installs no ILM rule. Any expiry rule on a live
  instance is therefore **operator/instance-side configuration, not ours** — see
  "runtime data a human must check".
- **Archived-asset purge sweep** deletes `asset.objectKey`
  (`src/pipeline/archived-asset-purge-sweep.ts:263`) but enumerates **only**
  `status: 'archived'` assets (`:192-201`). A freshly pulled asset is
  `processing`/`ready`, never `archived`.
- **Abandoned-upload sweep** (`src/pipeline/abandoned-upload-sweep.ts:94-165`)
  writes **status only** (`uploading -> failed`, `:141`). It never touches object
  storage.
- **Direct-upload quota rollback** deletes the object
  (`src/routes/asset-upload.ts:624`) but only on the `PUT`-complete path and only
  when `quota.admit()` throws `QuotaExceededError`. The URL-pull path reserves
  *before* streaming and treats an over-cap pull as a permanent failure, so the
  job would be `failed`, not `done`
  (`src/pipeline/url-pull-worker.ts:116, 136, 147-153, 60-66`).
- **No move/rename after extract.** Extraction writes only asset-document fields;
  the source key is a single authoritative field (`Asset.objectKey`, resolved by
  `src/pipeline/source-object.ts:61-67`) and no code infers, rewrites or
  re-prefixes it after ingest. The only server-side `copyObject` calls are
  archive-tier relocation (`src/pipeline/archive-tier-relocation.ts:250`),
  archive rehydration (`src/pipeline/archive-tier-rehydrate.ts:193`) and packaged
  **output** relocation (`src/pipeline/output-relocation.ts:150`) — all
  operator-triggered tier/destination operations, none of them on the
  ingest→transcode path.

## Point 3 — does the pull report `done` before the multipart upload is committed?

**No. Positively ruled out from the code.**

`putStream` awaits the minio client's `putObject` and only then returns, and the
worker marks the job `done` strictly after that returns:

- `src/data/storage.ts:263-264` — `const result = await this.client.putObject(this.bucket, key, pass, opts.totalBytes); return { etag: result.etag, bytesTransferred: transferred };`
- `src/pipeline/url-pull-worker.ts:119-144` — `await deps.storage.putStream(…)`,
  then `await deps.jobs.update(jobId, { status: 'done', … })`.

And in the client, a known-size stream above the part size takes the multipart
path whose promise resolves **only after `completeMultipartUpload`**:

- `node_modules/minio/dist/esm/internal/client.mjs:1399-1404` — `calculatePartSize(size)`, then `uploadStream(...)` when `size > partSize`.
- `node_modules/minio/dist/esm/internal/client.mjs:1437-1511` — `uploadStream` uploads each part and ends with `return await this.completeMultipartUpload(bucketName, objectName, uploadId, eTags)` (`:1508`), awaited at `:1462-1509`.

So `status: done` **implies the object was committed** at the endpoint it was
written to. The reported `bytesTransferred` of 449,056,937 additionally shows
`Content-Length` was known (progress is only computed against a known total,
`src/pipeline/url-pull-worker.ts:122-131`), so the multipart branch — not the
"unknown size" branch — is what ran.

Two size-related notes recorded for completeness, neither of which can make the
object absent:

1. **Small clips take a different code path.** `size <= partSize` is buffered and
   PUT in one request (`client.mjs:1400-1402`); 449 MB exceeds the computed part
   size and is multipart. The paths differ, but both commit before resolving. The
   discriminator in the report is better explained by stack identity (point 1)
   than by this difference.
2. **Retry + resume interaction (latent, secondary).** A failed attempt leaves an
   orphaned multipart upload — the worker retries up to `MAX_ATTEMPTS`
   (`src/pipeline/url-pull-worker.ts:40, 101-158`) and nothing aborts the partial
   upload (`WorkspaceStorage.abortMultipartUpload`, `src/data/storage.ts:220-222`,
   is only used by the client-driven multipart route). The next attempt *resumes*
   it: `uploadStream` calls `findUploadId` and compares `listParts` etags
   (`client.mjs:1445-1455, 1469-1479`). Note that the client increments
   `partNumber` **before** using it in the part request
   (`client.mjs:1480` vs `:1486`), so the first part is uploaded as part 2 and the
   resume comparison is keyed one off the server's numbering. That is a
   correctness risk for *resumed* large uploads (wrong-offset or duplicated part
   content), **not** a disappearance mechanism — and large files are the only ones
   that reach it. Filed separately as **#1088**; it does not explain #1058.

## Conclusion

Root cause: **an endpoint-resolution asymmetry between the data plane and the
transcode control plane on a multi-stack installation.**

- Everything that writes or reads bytes through this API resolves the stack with
  **no name** → the first-listed stack (`src/main.ts:658-664`,
  `src/data/per-workspace-repos.ts:77`,
  `src/services/workspace-stack.ts:874-886`).
- The transcode submission resolves the stack **from `X-Stack-Name`** → the named
  stack (`src/routes/assets.ts:1775-1781, 4433`, `src/main.ts:1871-1872`,
  `src/services/workspace-stack.ts:998-1012`), and that identity selects the
  `s3Endpoint` the transcoder is created with (`src/main.ts:1151-1176`,
  `src/services/encore-s3-config.ts:218-237`,
  `src/encore-scaler/instance-pool.ts:367-372`).
- Identical bucket names on every stack (`src/routes/provision.ts:59`) plus a
  bucket-only preflight (`src/services/stack-reachability.ts:100-104`) make the
  mismatch silent until ffprobe reports `NoSuchKey`.

Issue #615 introduced per-request stack keying for the control plane; the data
plane was never threaded through, so for any request that names a stack other
than the first-listed one, the two halves address different object stores. Before
#615 the transcode path used the fixed deployment context, which fell through to
the same first-listed stack as the data plane — which is why this is a
regression that only appears on an installation with more than one stack.

## The fix

**The data plane now resolves the stack the request names.** Bytes and documents
move together, which is the invariant #1058 broke.

- `src/services/request-stack-context.ts` (new) holds the request's stack name in
  an `AsyncLocalStorage` store, plus the request-scoped `StorageFactory` built
  from it.
- `src/main.ts` establishes that store in a single `onRequest` hook — ahead of
  the existing `preHandler`, which now resolves `request.connections` from the
  same ambient name — and `storageFor` is `makeRequestScopedStorageFactory(stackResolver)`.
- `src/data/per-workspace-repos.ts` resolves with `currentRequestStackName()` on
  every call, so asset, job, pipeline, search, profile, collection, webhook and
  audit documents land on the stack the request named.
- Work detached from a handler inherits the store along the async resource chain:
  the URL-pull worker (`void runner(...)`) and the metadata extraction that
  follows it resolve the same stack the ingest request named, without threading a
  parameter through every call site.
  - One exception has to be threaded explicitly. The storage factory is a *cache*
    read (`resolveCached`), and a large pull can outlive the resolver's
    `CACHE_TTL_MS`; calling it again from the post-pull continuation would then
    THROW inside a detached promise — losing the extraction silently and raising
    an unhandled rejection — rather than return the wrong stack. So
    `POST /assets/ingest-url` resolves the handle ONCE while the request is in
    flight (`pullStorage`) and hands the same handle to both the pull and
    `triggerExtraction(..., pullStorage)`, the same shape
    `onObjectStored(assetId, objectKey, storage?)` already uses for the upload
    path. The continuation also carries a `.catch` now, so a failure to start the
    extraction is logged instead of being an unhandled rejection.
- Outside a request the store is empty and resolution falls back to the first
  listed stack — which is correct for a single-stack install but is NOT enough
  for the paths that settle work, so those re-enter the right stack explicitly:
  - **the OSC callbacks** (`src/routes/internal.ts`) carry no `X-Stack-Name`.
    The Encore completion callback decodes its stack from the `externalId` we
    issued (`encodeEncoreJobId(contextId, jobLocalId)`) and runs the whole
    handler in it. The packager callbacks carry no identity of ours at all — only
    our assetId on success, nothing on failure — so the success handler finds the
    stack that actually holds the asset (default first, then the other
    provisioned stacks) and the failure handler attributes once per provisioned
    stack. Without this a job on a non-first stack 404s on every callback and
    stays `running` with its asset `processing` forever.
  - **the scaler-tick reconcilers** (`reconcileFailedTranscodes` +
    `reconcileStalledPackages`, `src/main.ts`) are repository-driven with no
    request behind them, so they only ever enumerated the first-listed stack.
    They now run once inside each provisioned stack's context, via the new
    `WorkspaceStackResolver.listStackNames()`. This matters more than it looks:
    the reproduction in #1058 was settled by exactly this reconciler, so without
    it a non-default-stack transcode has no terminal-state path at all.
  - the remaining sweeps, the watch-folder, and durable persistence of the stack
    identity on the job/asset document are tracked in #1090.

### The packager failure callback's blast radius is now wider — deliberately

This is the one place where the fix makes an existing exposure bigger, so it is
stated plainly rather than buried in the diff.

`POST /api/v1/internal/packagerCallback/failure` is **unauthenticated and carries
no identifier of ours** — the packager has none to send, so the body is only
`{ message }`. The handler therefore correlates by *execution state*: it fails
every execution currently stalled on a running `package` step, settles each one's
package `Job`, and dispatches a `package.failed` webhook for each. That fan-out
is not new (issue #209 chose state-correlation precisely because there is no id),
but it previously stopped at the first-listed stack. It now runs on **every
provisioned stack**, because the payload carries no stack identity either and the
alternative is that a packaging failure on any other stack is never attributed
and that execution stalls forever — the very class of bug this issue is about.

So the honest statement of the change: one unauthenticated POST whose only
content is a free-text message can fail every in-flight packaging job in the
deployment, where before it could fail every in-flight packaging job on one
stack. A strict superset of an already-accepted behaviour.

**Why that is bounded.** The unit of isolation is fixed by
`docs/architecture/ADR-020-quota-deployment-model-and-metering-source.md`,
Decision 1: *"One deployed open-videocore instance is one tenant."* (Cited by
filename on purpose — two ADR files share the number 020 and two share 018, and
ADR-018's "stack" wording is a different document that does not establish this.)
Stacks 2..N of a deployment are additional stacks of the *same* tenant, not other
customers — so the widened sweep reaches more of one
tenant's own work and crosses no tenant boundary. The pre-existing within-stack
fan-out was accepted on exactly that reasoning; this is the same reasoning applied
to the same tenant's other stacks. If the isolation model ever changes so that a
deployment hosts more than one tenant, this endpoint must be revisited **before**
that lands.

**What would actually close it** is an identifier on the failure callback — a
packager-side correlation id, so attribution is a lookup instead of a sweep.
That is upstream work, logged in the `encore-packager` contract friction log; a
shared callback secret (issue #9's friction log) would separately stop a forged
call reaching the handler at all. Both are better answers than narrowing the
sweep, which would just restore the stalled-forever bug for non-default stacks.
The current state is recorded in the SECURITY NOTE at the top of
`src/routes/internal.ts` and pinned by a test that asserts the fan-out on both
the default and a named stack.

**A fail-loud guard backs it up.** `POST /:id/transcode` and `POST /:id/execute`
compare the data
plane's resolved stack identity (`request.connections.stackName`, new on
`WorkspaceConnections` and set from the name the config was loaded under) against
the control plane's (`resolveStackContext`, issue #615). A disagreement returns
`409 stack_routing_mismatch` naming both stacks, instead of submitting a job that
can only fail with an indistinguishable 404. On `execute` the check runs for any
pipeline that CONTAINS a transcode step (not merely one that starts with it —
the live reproduction used `abr-vod`, where transcode is reached after the
execution record would have been created) and before that record is created, so
a split never leaves a dangling execution. The comparison is on stack
**identity**, never on endpoint hostname: the transcoder correctly uses the
in-cluster address while the API uses the public ingress for the same instance
(#991), so hostnames legitimately differ.

The submit-time reachability preflight now probes the resolved stack's own source
bucket (`request.connections?.sourceBucket`) rather than the deployment-wide boot
default.

Regression coverage: `test/stack-routing-callbacks.test.ts` covers the
request-less paths — a header-less Encore callback settling a stack-`b` job, the
unchanged default-stack case, an unknown job still 404ing, and both packager
callbacks reaching a non-default stack.

`test/stack-routing-data-plane.test.ts` reproduces the
two-stack divergence — stacks `['a','b']`, requests carrying `X-Stack-Name: b` —
for the ingest-url write, the `/files` presigned URL and the transcode source
read, the mismatch guard on both `transcode` and `execute`, and the unchanged
no-header default. Reverting the ambient lookup to `undefined` (i.e. the pre-fix
"always the first listed stack" behaviour) fails five of the six original
data-plane cases and three of the six callback cases.

### What was deliberately NOT done

- **Pointing the control plane at the data plane's stack** (making
  `transcodeContext` resolve with no name) would have been two lines, but it
  disables #615, whose behaviour is pinned by
  `test/transcode-stack-routing.test.ts` and
  `src/services/transcode-namespace-acceptance.test.ts`. Removing a tested
  routing guarantee is an architecture decision, not a bug fix.
- **Persisting the stack identity on the job/asset document.** The ambient
  identity lives for the life of the request, so work that must re-resolve after
  a process restart has nothing durable to re-enter with. The settle paths above
  are covered by their own identity sources; the remaining sweeps and the
  watch-folder are not. Tracked as **#1090**, which needs an architect call on
  whether a sweep is per-deployment or per-stack.
- **Making the storage-quota reconciler stack-aware.** The 6 h sweep (ADR-020
  Decision 2, `src/main.ts`) resolves `resolveCached()` with no name at boot and
  sums only the first-listed stack's buckets — then *overwrites* the committed
  total. Now that bytes can land on any named stack, usage on stacks 2..N is
  erased from the counter on every sweep, so the cap silently UNDER-counts. Called
  out separately from the other sweeps on **#1090** because the consequence is
  distinct: the others fail to act on assets, this one mis-states a
  billing-adjacent number. Deliberately not fixed here — "sum every provisioned
  stack" is the architect call #1090 is waiting on, not a bug fix, and the code
  comment at the wiring site now says so.
- **A large-file (>= 400 MB) regression test.** #1058's acceptance criteria asked
  for one if the fix shipped alongside the diagnosis. It is **waived
  deliberately**, because Point 3 establishes that payload size is a confounded
  variable rather than a cause: both minio upload branches commit the object
  before the pull resolves, so the single-part and multipart paths are
  indistinguishable from the worker's point of view, and the bug is a *routing*
  defect — the write and the read address different stacks regardless of how many
  bytes moved. A 400 MB fixture would assert nothing the 17-byte payload in
  `test/stack-routing-data-plane.test.ts` does not already assert, while adding
  minutes to every CI run. What size *did* affect is the reporter's experience,
  not the mechanism: a large upload is simply the case an operator notices,
  because a short one fails fast enough to look like a transient error. The
  routing claim is pinned instead by asserting WHICH stack each half resolves —
  the six data-plane cases and six callback cases above — which is the actual
  invariant. If a size-dependent failure is ever observed *after* this fix, it is
  a different bug and should get its own issue rather than retro-fitting this one.

## Remediation for assets already misrouted

The fix changes where *new* work resolves; it does not move bytes or documents
that are already split. On an installation that ran the broken combination
(more than one provisioned stack, requests naming a non-first stack), an affected
asset has its document **and** its object on the first-listed stack, while the
client believes it belongs to the named stack. After this fix those assets are no
longer visible to a request that names the other stack.

Identify them first — they are exactly the assets that exist on the first-listed
stack but were created by requests naming a different one:

1. `GET /api/v1/provision/` lists the provisioned stack names; element 0 is the
   stack everything previously resolved to.
2. List assets with **no** `X-Stack-Name` (the first-listed stack). Any asset a
   client expects to find under another stack name is affected.
3. The resolver's own logs discriminate without guessing: a request logs
   `{ source: 'x-stack-name', stackName }` for the header resolution and
   `{ source: 'default', listed: [...] }` for the unnamed one. An ingest whose
   `stackName` differs from `listed[0]` produced a misrouted asset.

Then choose per asset:

- **Leave it on the first-listed stack** (cheapest). Address it with no
  `X-Stack-Name`, or with the first-listed stack's name. Everything — documents,
  bytes, `/files` URLs, transcode — is self-consistent there.
- **Move it to the stack it was meant for.** Copy the object between the two
  object stores at the same key (`ingest/<assetId>`; both stacks use the same
  bucket name, so only the endpoint differs), then re-create the asset document
  on the target stack with the same `objectKey` and re-run extraction. There is
  no supported server-side cross-stack copy today.
- **Re-ingest.** For assets whose source URL is still available, re-running
  `POST /api/v1/assets/ingest-url` with the intended `X-Stack-Name` now produces a
  correctly routed asset, and the old one can be archived.

Do **not** attempt to repair this by editing only the asset document: a document
on one stack pointing at an object on another is the exact state this issue is
about, and nothing detects it.

## Runtime data that confirmed this

The analysis above is from the code; it was subsequently **confirmed by
experiment** on a two-stack install (#1058 comment, 2026-10-02 12:26–12:39 UTC):
the write landed on the first-listed stack, the `/files` URL named it under
either header, and the transcoder read the header-named stack and 404'd. The
checks below are retained because they are how an operator identifies affected
assets on their own installation (see "Remediation" above):

1. **Did the failing requests carry an `X-Stack-Name` naming a non-first stack?**
   The resolver already logs both halves: `{ source: 'x-stack-name', namespace,
   stackName }` when a header is present
   (`src/services/workspace-stack.ts:855-858`) and `{ source: 'default',
   namespace, listed: <names> }` for the no-header resolution (`:880-883`). If
   `stackName` on the failing ingest/transcode requests differs from
   `listed[0]`, the diagnosis is confirmed outright. Also compare the
   `encore-scaler: using the in-cluster object-store endpoint` /
   `failed its health probe` lines (`src/services/internal-minio-endpoint.ts:610-628`)
   for the endpoint host actually handed to the transcoder.
2. **Object-storage audit/access logs for both instances**, filtered on
   `ingest/<assetId>`: expect a successful multipart PUT + GET (the probe) on one
   instance and only a failed GET (`NoSuchKey`) on the other. A `DELETE` on the
   first instance would instead point at an instance-side ILM rule (point 2
   showed this codebase issues none).
3. **Each instance's ILM / lifecycle configuration**, to rule out an
   operator-configured expiry or incomplete-multipart-abort rule. Not derivable
   from the codebase.

A cheap positive control that needs no logs: ingest and transcode the same
449 MB file with **no** `X-Stack-Name` header at all. If it succeeds, the file
size is exonerated and the stack asymmetry is the cause.
