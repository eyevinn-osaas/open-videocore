# Interaction spec: export-action states — in progress, success, failure, not-available, no destinations

**Issue:** #911 (broken out from #796, which itself sat behind the outcome-honesty fix in
#944). Feeds the implementation ticket that adds the export action to the web UI.
**Status:** design spec. No production code accompanies it — there is no export action in
`public/` yet (verified below), so there is nothing to retrofit.
**Audience:** whoever implements the export button/panel on asset detail, plus anyone
writing operator copy about export.

**Revised after review:** the first draft routed each state's whole payload through `showMsg`,
which renders `textContent` and removes itself after 6s — so the markup it prescribed would have
shipped as visible asterisks and the success link would have vanished. Every state now names the
plain string that goes through `showMsg` and, separately, the persistent sibling DOM that carries
anything else (§0.4). The 502 `message` is no longer specified for verbatim display: three of
the paths that produce it carry upstream-controlled text this repo does not bound — including
one *inside* the bounded `try`, whose raw cause is interpolated into an otherwise repo-written
sentence (§0.1) — so § "Export failed" sanitises it.

This pins **copy and visual treatment** for five states. Four belong to one action — `POST
/api/v1/assets/{id}/export` (the "re-wrap" action — copies a source into a new container
format without re-encoding). The fifth, the issue's "zero destinations configured"
criterion, belongs to the sibling **delivery** action `POST /api/v1/assets/{id}/deliver`,
which is where a destination is actually chosen. This spec does not restate the contract, it
cites it — by **symbol name**, not line number, so a citation stays greppable as the files
move.

**Every cross-reference to a state uses the section's *name*, never its number.** State
numbers have already drifted once — a vocabulary section was inserted mid-review and silently
pointed every numeric reference at the wrong state. Refer to a state by its heading text, so
inserting a section can never make a reference wrong. The only numeric references left are to
the contract-grounding subsections `§0.1`–`§0.4` below, which exist solely to avoid repeating
long headings in table cells; if you insert a subsection there, renumber the refs or switch
them to names too.

## 0. Contract grounding

Everything below was read from this tree on branch `issue-911/export-action-states` after
merging `origin/main`: `openapi.json`, the route source, the pipeline source, the
storage-backend registry, and `public/`. Nothing is taken from the issue text. Every citation
names a symbol, selector, or `openapi.json` path you can grep for.

### 0.1 The export (re-wrap) action

| What | Exact symbol verified |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST /api/v1/assets/{id}/export`. Handler: the `app.post('/:id/export', …)` registration in `src/routes/assets.ts`. `openapi.json` → `paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}/export"].post` declares exactly `201, 400, 404, 409, 501, 502` |
| Request body | `exportBodySchema`, `src/routes/assets.ts`: `{ targetFormat: 'mp4'\|'mkv'\|'mov'\|'mxf'\|'ts'` (required) `, outputName?: string(1..256), asVersion?: boolean }`. **No destination field of any kind** — confirmed against `openapi.json` → `paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}/export"].post.requestBody`, which has `additionalProperties: false`. See §0.2 for what this does and does not imply |
| 201 body | `assetSchema` (`src/routes/assets.ts`) — the new child asset. Relevant fields for this spec: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `status` (`'ready'` on a 201), `parentId` (= source asset id), `objectKey` (present directly on the response — no extra fetch needed to know where the output landed) |
| Default child name | `outputName`, else `<source name> [<format>]` — the `name:` property of the child-asset literal in `rewrap()`, `src/pipeline/rewrap.ts`, which reads `outputName ?? \`${baseName} [${targetFormat}]\``. `baseName` is the `const baseName = source?.name ?? sourceAssetId` binding in the same function (it is **not** the `isRewrapFormat` guard a few lines above it — grep the identifier, not a line) |
| Output object key | `exports/<newAssetId>.<format>` — `rewrapObjectKey`, `src/pipeline/rewrap.ts` |
| **201 is falsifiable** | Three layers agree before it is sent: job-status allow-list (`SUCCESS_STATUSES`, `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts`), the `deps.storage.statObject(outputKey)` HEAD + non-empty check in `rewrap()` (`src/pipeline/rewrap.ts`), only then the `ready` transition. Documented contract note: `docs/findings/export-truthful-status-944.md` |
| 400 | Unsupported `targetFormat` — the Zod enum built from `REWRAP_FORMATS` at the edge; `UnsupportedFormatError` thrown defensively behind the `isRewrapFormat` guard in `rewrap()` (`src/pipeline/rewrap.ts`). **Two different bodies, depending on which layer rejects.** The *defensive* path is fully verified: `UnsupportedFormatError` → the router's `setErrorHandler` → `errorSchema`-shaped `{ error: 'unsupported_format', message }` (`src/routes/assets.ts:3330`). The *edge* path (Zod enum rejection) is **not verified in this tree, and this spec does not assert its envelope.** What *is* verified: schema validation is done by `fastify-type-provider-zod` ^4.0.2's compilers, not Fastify's built-in ajv (`app.setValidatorCompiler(validatorCompiler)` / `setSerializerCompiler`, `src/main.ts:225-226`, imported at `src/main.ts:17-21`); there is **no `schemaErrorFormatter` anywhere in `src/`** (grepped); the router's error handler has no branch for a validation error and ends in `throw err` (`src/routes/assets.ts:3332`); and the only test covering this path asserts the status code alone, no body (`test/rewrap.test.ts:341-350`, `expect(res.statusCode).toBe(400)`). So the provable claim — and the only one the UI needs — is that an **edge 400 carries some `error` value that is not `unsupported_format`**; the exact field set is unconfirmed. That is sufficient, because the UI's rule is to render a server string only for `rewrap_failed` (§ "Export failed") and to use its own fixed copy for every other `error` value. If the edge envelope ever needs to be relied on, assert it in `test/rewrap.test.ts` first and cite the assertion here |
| 404 | Unknown/foreign asset — `reply.code(404).send({ error: 'not_found' })` in the export handler. Existence is not leaked |
| 409 | `{ error: 'no_object', message: 'asset has no stored source object to process' }` — `NO_SOURCE_OBJECT_ERROR` / `NO_SOURCE_OBJECT_MESSAGE`, `src/pipeline/source-object.ts`, sent by the shared `requireSourceObject` helper, which the export handler calls before the 501 configuration guard. It is **not** the handler's first check: `const asset = await repo.get(request.params.id)` and its `404 not_found` run first (`src/routes/assets.ts:5776-5778`), then `requireSourceObject` (`:5781`), then the 501 guard. So an unknown id 404s before this 409 can be reached |
| **501** | `{ error: 'not_configured', message: 'export / re-wrap is not configured' }` — the `if (!opts.rewrapRunner \|\| !storageFor)` guard in the export handler (deployment never wired a re-wrap runner or workspace storage). This is the only "nowhere for an export to go" condition **this endpoint** can produce — see § "Export is not available on this deployment" |
| 502 | `{ error: 'rewrap_failed', message: string }` — the `reply.code(502).send({ error: 'rewrap_failed', message })` in the export handler's catch, where `message` is `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)`. The ffmpeg log is captured server-side only (`oscJobLog(err)`, logged at `warn` in the same catch) and is **never** in `message` — a deliberate security position (the log is third-party output and can carry storage endpoints/bucket names), not an oversight. `message` is what the UI has to show; it is real, not generic ("Export failed") |
| **Exactly one 502 `message` shape is fully composed by this repo; THREE paths can carry upstream text** | Only the **non-success-status** sentence is wholly this repo's words: inside the `try` at `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:141-153`, `makeOscRewrapRunner` sets `failure = OSC export/re-wrap job "<name>" ended with non-success status "<status>"` (`:149`) from a `SUCCESS_STATUSES` allow-list miss, then throws `OscRewrapJobError(failure, logs)` (`:166`) — ffmpeg log as data, never in the message. **Three paths put upstream-controlled text in `message`, and being inside that `try` does not make a path safe:** (1) `await api.context.getServiceAccessToken(FFPROBE_SERVICE_ID)` (`src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:126`), **outside** the `try`; (2) `await api.createJob(api.context, FFPROBE_SERVICE_ID, sat, {…})` (`:128`), **outside** the `try`; (3) `const job = await api.getJob(api.context, serviceId, name, sat)` (`src/pipeline/osc-job-poll.ts:123`) — a bare `await` in the poll loop, **inside** the `try`, whose `FetchError` is caught at `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:151-153` and **interpolated raw** into `` failure = `OSC export/re-wrap job "<name>" did not complete: ${err.message}` `` (`:152`). Paths 1 and 2 reach the route catch verbatim; path 3 arrives prefixed by a repo-written clause but with the unbounded `err.message` intact after `did not complete: `. A prefix is not a bound. All three share one SDK error contract: `@osaas/client-core` 0.24.0 (`package.json:27`) raises a `FetchError` whose `message` is the upstream response body verbatim (`lib/fetch.js:16`) or, for a JSON error body lacking `message`/`reason`, that whole body `JSON.stringify`-ed (`lib/fetch.js:9`) — no length bound, no structured cause. The `:128` call is the sharpest because the request in flight carries `cmdLineArgs` from `rewrapCmdLine` (presigned source URL **with its signature**) plus `awsAccessKeyId` / `awsSecretAccessKey`; `:126` posts only `{ serviceId }` (`lib/context.js:37-39`) and `osc-job-poll.ts:123` is a `GET` with no body, so those two are unbounded prose rather than credential-leak vectors. This repo bounds none of the three, so **the UI must not render a 502 `message` unbounded** — see the bounding rules in § "Export failed". Logged as OSC friction: `docs/osc-feedback/incoming-client-core-job-submission-unbounded-error-text.md` in the agents repo |
| Failed export leaves no file to serve | `rewrap()` sets `objectKey` only **after** verification passes (the `update` calls follow the `statObject` guard, `src/pipeline/rewrap.ts`) — a `502` child is `status: 'failed'` with **no** `objectKey`, so it can never 200 a `/files` entry for bytes that don't exist |
| Synchronous, no polling | The handler `await`s the resolved runner inline; there is no `processing`-then-poll contract for this action. The only "in progress" state is the one request in flight |
| Source unchanged | Export is a pure read of the source asset — never mutated |

### 0.2 The export-destinations registry — and why "zero destinations" IS reachable

`exportBodySchema` has no `destination` field, so **`POST /:id/export` never consults the
export-destinations registry and cannot be gated by it.** It always writes to the workspace's
own provisioned storage (`storageFor()`). That much is unchanged.

What *has* changed, and what an earlier draft of this spec got wrong: the registry is **no
longer** consumed only by `POST /:id/package` and `POST /:id/execute`. `main` now carries a
third consumer, and it makes the issue's "zero destinations configured" criterion a real,
reachable state.

| What | Exact symbol verified |
|---|---|
| Delivery endpoint | `POST /api/v1/assets/{id}/deliver` (issue #1131, merged in #1158). `openapi.json` → `paths["/api/v1/assets/{id}/deliver"].post`. Handler: the `app.post('/:id/deliver', …)` registration in `src/routes/assets.ts` |
| Destination is **required** | `deliverBodySchema`, `src/routes/assets.ts`. `openapi.json` → the same path's `requestBody.content["application/json"].schema` is `{ properties: { destination: { type: 'string', minLength: 1, maxLength: 256 } }, required: ['destination'], additionalProperties: false }`. There is no implicit fallback: a delivery **cannot** be issued without naming a destination |
| Resolved through the same registry | `registry.resolveForOutput(STACK_CONFIG_NAMESPACE, ref)` in the deliver handler, then `resolveJobDestination` — the same resolver `/:id/package` and `/:id/execute` use |
| **The implicit default is refused** | `resolveForOutput` (`src/services/storage-backend-registry.ts`) opens with `if (idOrName === DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID) return undefined;` — **by design**, documented in the comment above it ("the implicit OSC-managed default resolves to undefined: it is NOT an external backend"). The deliver handler therefore checks `ref === DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID` first and answers `400 { error: 'bad_request', message: '"default" is the platform-managed default store the asset already lives in, not an export destination; name a destination registered via POST /api/v1/export-destinations' }` |
| `DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID` | `export const DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID = 'default' as const` — `src/services/storage-backend-registry.ts` |
| The registry list always contains that default | `StorageBackendRegistry.list()` returns `[defaultBackendView(), ...views]` — it **unconditionally prepends** the synthetic default (`defaultBackendView()`: `id: 'default'`, `name: 'OSC-managed default'`, `role: 'both'`, `deletable: false`), `src/services/storage-backend-registry.ts` |
| …and that default passes the destinations filter | `isExportDestination(role)` returns `role === 'packaged' \|\| role === 'both'` — `src/routes/export-destinations.ts`. The default's `role` is `'both'`, so it survives the filter in the `app.get('/', …)` handler of the same file |
| `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` | `openapi.json` → `paths["/api/v1/export-destinations/"].get` declares `200` (`{ destinations: [...] }`, each entry `{ id, name, role, backend, bucket, accessKeyId, hasSessionToken, deletable, createdAt, credentials, … }`) and `501`. The `501` body is `notConfiguredPayload` (`src/routes/export-destinations.ts`) = `{ error: 'not_configured', message: 'export destinations are not configured' }` — the registry itself isn't wired (no param store / no secret storage) |
| Non-output backends never reach a picker | The list is filtered by `isExportDestination`, so `role: 'source'` / `'archive'` backends are absent from `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` entirely. The deliver handler's own `422 { error: 'backend_role' }` for those roles is therefore unreachable from a picker built off this list — it exists for direct API callers |

**The correct conclusion.** Combine the two rows in bold:

- `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` can never return a literally empty `destinations` array
  while the registry is configured — `list()` always prepends the default.
- But the only entry in that array on a fresh deployment is the `default`, and `POST
  /:id/deliver` **refuses** `default` with a `400`.

So a deployment whose registry holds nothing but the default has **zero *usable* export
destinations**: every destination the API will show you is one the delivery endpoint will
reject. That is precisely issue #911's "zero destinations configured" acceptance criterion,
and it is the *default* condition of any deployment where no operator has yet called `POST
/api/v1/export-destinations`. It is reachable, it is common, and it must be designed for —
see § "No export destinations are configured".

The predicate a UI must evaluate is therefore **not** `destinations.length === 0`. It is:

```js
// Deliverable destinations = the list minus the implicit default, which
// POST /:id/deliver answers 400 for (resolveForOutput returns undefined for
// DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID by design — storage-backend-registry.ts).
const deliverable = destinations.filter(d => d.id !== 'default');
```

`deliverable.length === 0` is the no-destinations state. A picker must also **exclude** the
`default` entry from its options rather than merely warning about it — offering a choice the
endpoint answers `400` for is the same class of dishonesty #944 removed from the API side.

Two conditions that look alike and are not, and must not share copy:

| Condition | API shape | Who fixes it, and how |
|---|---|---|
| Registry not wired at all | `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` → `501 { error: 'not_configured', message: 'export destinations are not configured' }`; `POST /:id/deliver` → `501 { error: 'not_configured', message: 'storage-backend registry is not configured' }` (two different sentences for one condition — the UI should use its own copy, below, not echo either) | Whoever provisions the deployment — a service/param-store gap. Nothing an operator can do from this UI |
| Registry wired, nothing registered | `GET` → `200` with only the `default` entry; a delivery attempt would `400` | An operator, from this UI's own surface — `POST /api/v1/export-destinations` |

### 0.3 A UI cannot say *where* a file landed via `type: 'export'` — the enum member is unused

`assetFileSchema.type` (`GET /:id/files`, `src/routes/assets.ts`) declares
`z.enum(['source', 'rendition', 'export'])`, but the handler registered at
`app.get('/:id/files', …)` only ever pushes `type: 'source'` (from `asset.objectKey`) or
`type: 'rendition'`. Grepping `src/routes/assets.ts` for `type: 'export'` returns no
assignment — only the enum declaration. **An exported child asset's own stored object is
reported as `type: 'source'` through `/:id/files`, not `type: 'export'`.** This spec
therefore does not use `/:id/files` to identify the export at all — § "Export succeeded"
reads `objectKey`/`name`/`id` straight off the **201 response body**, which needs no further
request and is not subject to this gap. (Noted for the implementer so nobody later writes a
`.filter(f => f.type === 'export')` that silently matches nothing.)

### 0.4 What already exists in `public/` to build on

No export UI and no delivery UI exist yet — `grep -rn "rewrap\|targetFormat" public/*.js
public/*.html` and `grep -rn "export-destinations\|destination" public/*.js` both return
nothing (the hits for the literal string `export` elsewhere in `public/*.js` are all
ES-module `export function`/`export const` statements, not this feature). The nearest sibling
actions already wired — the `#btn-thumbnails` and `#btn-extract-meta` click handlers in
`public/app.js` — establish the pattern this spec reuses rather than inventing new
primitives:

| Primitive | Where (greppable symbol / selector) | Reused for |
|---|---|---|
| **`showMsg(container, text, type)` — plain text only, and self-destructing.** It builds `<div class="msg msg-{info\|success\|error}">`, assigns **`el.textContent = text`**, appends that to `container`, then schedules `el.remove()` after **6000 ms**. Two consequences constrain every state below, and they are the reason this spec's copy is shaped the way it is: **(a)** `text` is a plain string rendered *as text* — it cannot carry an anchor, a `data-asset-id` attribute, a `<span class="text-mono">`, or bold/emphasis of any kind. Markup or markdown written into it is shown to the operator verbatim, characters and all. **(b)** the element it creates is **gone six seconds later**, so nothing the operator still needs may live inside it. | `function showMsg` in `public/app.js`; CSS rules `.msg`, `.msg-info`, `.msg-success`, `.msg-error` in `public/style.css` | the **one plain sentence** of status in § "Export in progress" (`info`), § "Export succeeded" (`success`), § "Export failed" (`error`) — and nothing beyond a sentence |
| **Sibling-append, for anything `showMsg` cannot carry.** Construct the richer node yourself and `appendChild` it to the **same container**, as a *sibling* of the message box — never inside it. A sibling is not on `showMsg`'s timer, so it survives after the message box removes itself. | the `#btn-extract-meta` handler in `public/app.js`: immediately after its `showMsg(actionMsg, …)` call it does `const pre = document.createElement('pre'); pre.className = 'code-block mt8'; pre.textContent = JSON.stringify(r, null, 2);` then `actionMsg.appendChild(pre);` — the `<pre>` is a sibling of the `.msg` div and outlives it. The same handler opens with `actionMsg.innerHTML = ''`, which is how a previous run's persistent sibling is retired before a new one is posted | § "Export succeeded"'s result row (link + id), § "Export failed"'s persistent diagnostic |
| Click-to-copy identifier — **do not hand-roll a second clipboard path** | `copyableIdCellHtml(value, label)` and `wireCopyIdButtons(root)`, exported from `public/copy-id.js` (button class constant `COPY_ID_BTN_CLASS`). `copyableIdCellHtml` returns **already-escaped HTML**: a `.cell-id.cell-id-value` span holding the full value as selectable text, plus an `aria-live="polite"` button carrying `data-copy-id`. `wireCopyIdButtons` binds the behaviour for every such button under `root` and is **idempotent** (it marks `dataset.copyIdWired`), so calling it after each render is safe. Live consumers to copy the call pattern from: `public/assets-table.js` (`wireCopyIdButtons(tbody)` after building rows) and `public/app.js`'s asset-detail key/value block (`wireCopyIdButtons(kvDiv)`) | § "Export succeeded"'s child-asset id |
| Disable + relabel the triggering button while a request is in flight | the `#btn-extract-meta` handler in `public/app.js`: `var prevLabel = extractBtn.textContent; extractBtn.disabled = true; …` restored as `extractBtn.disabled = false; extractBtn.textContent = prevLabel;` in a `finally` | § "Export in progress" |
| `err.status` / `err.body` / `err.message` surfaced by `apiFetch` (`async function apiFetch` in `public/app.js`, whose error path assigns `msg = body.message \|\| body.error \|\| msg` over a `'HTTP ' + res.status` default) | `public/app.js` | § "Export failed" reads `err.status`, `err.body.error` **and** `err.message` — it branches on `err.body.error` first and renders `err.message` only for `rewrap_failed`, bounded, because the 502 `message` is not a trusted string on every path (§0.1) |
| "…is not configured for this stack" / disabled-with-reason convention (pipeline picker) rather than a generic failure | `function notConfiguredText` and `function optionalServiceNames` in `public/app.js` | § "Export is not available on this deployment", § "No export destinations are configured" |
| A distinct, non-`.msg-error` terminal-state block for a condition a retry can't fix, with an uppercase label row and a machine-readable outcome | `function renderPurgedUnrecoverable` in `public/app.js` (sets `className = 'msg msg-unrecoverable'`, `role="alert"`, `data-outcome="unrecoverable"`); CSS `.msg-unrecoverable` and its `.unrecoverable-label` / `.unrecoverable-body` / `.unrecoverable-detail` children in `public/style.css` | Pattern reused (not the component itself — that one is 410-specific) for the distinct visual identity of the two unavailable states |
| `data-asset-id` link → `showAssetDetail(id, panel)`, monospace id convention | the `.job-asset-link` anchor built in `renderJobDetailBody` (`public/app.js`), whose click handler calls `opts.onAssetLink(assetLink.dataset.assetId)`; the embedded caller supplies that `onAssetLink` as `switchTab('assets'); showAssetDetail(assetId, panel)` in `showJobDetail`. The id is rendered with `.text-mono` (`public/style.css`) — as the link text only when `job.assetName` is absent, otherwise as a separate `.job-asset-id-inline` span. Because this is an element with an attribute and a click listener, it **must** be built as sibling DOM (row above) — it cannot be passed through `showMsg` | § "Export succeeded"'s "open the export" link |

---

## 1. Vocabulary

One noun, one verb, everywhere in this feature's copy.

| Use | Do not use |
|---|---|
| **Export** (the action and the noun for its output) | "Re-wrap", "Rewrap" — that is the pipeline's internal name (`rewrap.ts`, `osc-rewrap.ts`) and is not shown to a user. Keep it out of UI copy entirely |
| **container format** (what `targetFormat` picks) | "codec" — a rewrap is `-c copy`; no stream is re-encoded, so "codec" would claim something false |
| **source** (the asset being exported) | "original", "parent" — `parentId` names a different, more general relationship than this one action |
| **destination** (a registered place a *delivery* writes to) | "export location", "target" — the contract's noun is `destination` (`deliverBodySchema`, `GET /api/v1/export-destinations`); any other word makes the API and the UI disagree |
| **deliver / delivery** (moving an existing object to a destination) | "export" for that action — export produces a new container; delivery moves bytes that already exist. Conflating them is why the "zero destinations" criterion was mis-analysed once already |
| the five states below: **in progress / exported / export failed / export not available / no destinations** | "pending", "complete", "error", "disabled" alone — too generic for status text; fine as internal/CSS state names only |

---

## 2. State: export in progress

**Trigger:** the operator submits the export form (chosen `targetFormat`, optional
`outputName`). The request is in flight. There is no server-side `processing` status to poll
for this action (§0.1: synchronous) — this state exists purely client-side, for the one
request.

**Visual treatment:**
- Disable the submit control and every format/filename input for the duration of the
  request — there is nothing to interrupt (no job id, no cancel contract) and a second
  submit while one is in flight would create a second, unrelated child asset.
- Relabel the submit control to a busy state (reuse the `extractBtn`/`prevLabel` pattern
  from the `#btn-extract-meta` handler, §0.4): button text becomes **"Exporting…"**,
  restored to its prior label in a `finally` regardless of outcome.
- Post an `info` message via `showMsg`. The string, exactly — **no markup, no emphasis**,
  because `showMsg` renders it as `textContent` (§0.4):

  ```js
  showMsg(actionMsg, 'Exporting to ' + FORMAT + '…', 'info');
  ```

  which reads: `Exporting to MP4…`

  `{FORMAT}` is the exact `targetFormat` value the operator picked (`mp4`/`mkv`/`mov`/`mxf`/`ts`),
  uppercased for the message only — never invent a longer format name the contract doesn't
  carry. This state needs no sibling DOM and no persistence: it is replaced within one request
  by either outcome, and its 6s self-destruct is harmless here because it carries nothing the
  operator has to keep.

**Do not** show a progress bar or percentage — the contract exposes no job id, no poll
endpoint and no partial-progress signal for this action (§0.1). A determinate progress UI
here would be fabricating data the API doesn't have, which is exactly the "false success"
failure mode #944 fixed on the other end of this same request.

---

## 3. State: export succeeded (201)

**Trigger:** `201` with the new child asset body.

**Visual treatment — two pieces, because one primitive cannot do both.** `showMsg` renders
`textContent` and deletes itself after 6s (§0.4), so the *sentence* goes through `showMsg` and
the *result* — the link and the id, which are this state's entire answer to "where did the
export land" — is built as **persistent sibling DOM** next to it, following the
`#btn-extract-meta` `actionMsg.appendChild(pre)` precedent (§0.4). Clear the host first, the
way that handler does, so a previous run's result row is retired rather than stacked.

**(a) The status sentence** — a plain string, no markup, no emphasis:

```js
actionMsg.innerHTML = '';                                  // retire the previous run's row
showMsg(actionMsg, 'Exported to ' + FORMAT + '.', 'success');
```

which reads: `Exported to MP4.`

- `{FORMAT}` — the submitted `targetFormat`, rendered as in § "Export in progress".
- The sentence deliberately does **not** name the output. It is allowed to vanish at 6s
  because the result row below it does not.

**(b) The result row** — appended to the same container, *after* the `showMsg` call, and
**not** on its timer. It must still be on screen minutes later, so an operator who looked away
can still find what was produced. It carries two things:

1. **A link whose text is the output's name**, opening the new child asset. Build an anchor
   with `data-asset-id="{id}"` and a click handler that calls `showAssetDetail(id, panel)`,
   reusing the `.job-asset-link` + `onAssetLink` convention (§0.4) — navigation already built
   for this exact "jump to a just-created, related asset" need, not a new route. The link text
   is the response body's `name` field, verbatim: already resolved server-side to either the
   operator's `outputName` or the `<source name> [<format>]` default (§0.1). Set it with
   `textContent`, never `innerHTML` — the name can contain `<`, `&` or quotes the operator
   typed into `outputName`.
2. **The child's id, as a click-to-copy control** — not as the link text. The existing
   `.job-asset-link` convention falls back to an id as link text only when no human name
   exists (`job.assetName || job.assetId`, §0.4), and an export's child always has a name
   (`assetSchema.name`, §0.1). So follow that handler's name-present branch and render the id
   separately. Use the module that already implements this — `copyableIdCellHtml(asset.id,
   'Copy asset id')` into the row's markup, then `wireCopyIdButtons(row)` (`public/copy-id.js`,
   §0.4). Do not hand-roll a clipboard call, do not invent a "(click to copy)" hint in prose:
   the component ships its own visible `Copy` button and its own `aria-live` feedback.

Rendered, the two pieces read as:

> Exported to MP4.
> → clip-master [mp4]   `01JQ7K9…` [Copy]

where `Exported to MP4.` is the `.msg-success` box that disappears, and the second line is the
row that stays. Any emphasis in this state is **CSS on the sibling row**, never asterisks in a
`showMsg` string.

**"Where it landed" — be precise about what is actually knowable:**
The response's `objectKey` (`exports/{childId}.{format}`) is the storage key, not a byte
location a non-technical operator can act on, and per §0.3's "unused enum member" finding the
UI must **not** attempt to resolve a download URL by filtering `/:id/files` for `type:
'export'` — that will silently match nothing. If the implementation wants an immediate
download affordance, it must fetch `GET /:id/files` for the new child and use the entry whose
`objectKey` equals the one just returned (the handler always reports it as `type: 'source'`,
§0.3) — not a `type` filter. That is an optional enhancement; the minimum state this ticket
requires is satisfied by the persistent result row above, which needs no second request.

**Do not** ship this state as a bare "export complete" with nothing that names the output.
#944's entire point is that a `201` is a verified claim about a *specific* object, so the state
has to show which one. The split above satisfies that between the two pieces, not within the
sentence — which is exactly why piece (b) is mandatory and not an enhancement. A `success`
`showMsg` on its own is **not** an implementation of this state.

**Accessibility:** the result row appears without a page change, as the outcome of an action the
operator just took, so give it `role="status"` (WCAG 2.1 AA, SC 4.1.3) — `renderPurgedUnrecoverable`
sets `role="alert"` for its terminal condition (§0.4); a successful export is not an alert.
Append the row *after* the `showMsg` call so the reading order matches the visual order.

---

## 4. State: export failed (502)

**Trigger:** the request resolves with HTTP `502`, body `{ error: 'rewrap_failed', message:
string }` (§0.1).

**Visual treatment — same two-piece split as § "Export succeeded", and for the same reason.**
The server's sentence is the *only* diagnostic the operator will ever get for this failure (the
ffmpeg log is server-side only, below), so it must not be put somewhere that deletes itself
after six seconds. The short failure headline goes through `showMsg`; the server's sentence is
appended as **persistent sibling DOM**:

**(a) The headline** — plain string, no markup:

```js
actionMsg.innerHTML = '';
showMsg(actionMsg, 'Export to ' + FORMAT + ' failed.', 'error');
```

**(b) The diagnostic line** — a sibling node that stays, built with `textContent` (the server's
sentence is not markup and must never be parsed as any):

```js
const detail = document.createElement('div');
detail.className = 'text-mono mt8';
detail.textContent = serverDetail;          // see the bounding rule below
actionMsg.appendChild(detail);
```

**Bounding rule for `serverDetail` — required, not optional.** `err.message` comes from
`apiFetch`'s `msg = body.message || body.error || msg` (§0.4). Exactly one 502 `message` shape
is wholly composed by this repo and safe to show: the non-success-status sentence
(`… ended with non-success status "<status>"`, `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:149`), whose only
variable part is a status string from the job API. **Three other paths carry upstream-controlled
text, and the UI cannot tell which shape it received** (there is no `reason` field to branch on
— §8 item 4):

1. `api.context.getServiceAccessToken(…)` (`src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:126`) — **outside** the
   `try` (which opens at `:141`); its error propagates unchanged into the route's catch.
2. `api.createJob(…)` (`:128`) — also outside the `try`; same verbatim propagation. The
   request in flight here carries `cmdLineArgs` built by `rewrapCmdLine` (the **presigned
   source URL with its signature**) plus `awsAccessKeyId` / `awsSecretAccessKey`.
3. `api.getJob(…)` (`src/pipeline/osc-job-poll.ts:123`) — a bare `await` in the poll loop,
   **inside** the `try`. Its `FetchError` is caught at `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:151-153`
   and the handler **interpolates the raw message**:
   `` failure = `OSC export/re-wrap job "${name}" did not complete: ${err.message}` `` (`:152`).

Path 3 is the one an earlier draft of this spec missed, and it is the instructive one: it sits
*inside* the bounded `try` and the sentence that reaches the client *is* partly repo-written —
yet everything after `did not complete: ` is unbounded upstream text. **A repo-written prefix is
not a bound.** The relevant property is never "where the `await` sits" but "can this `message`
contain upstream text anywhere in it".

In all three cases the route's catch does
`const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` and sends it as the
`rewrap_failed` 502 (`src/routes/assets.ts`). The SDK makes that text upstream-controlled and
unbounded (`@osaas/client-core` `lib/fetch.js:9,16` — response body verbatim, or the whole JSON
error body stringified; §0.1). Whether an upstream error echoes its request body is **not
something this repo bounds**. So the UI must treat the string as untrusted:

**Apply these four steps in this order** — the order is load-bearing, because scanning after
truncating would only scan the first 300 characters and let a credential in the tail through:

1. **Gate on the error code.** Render the string **only** when
   `err.body.error === 'rewrap_failed'`. Any other `error` value gets this state's own fixed
   copy (the table below) and the server string is dropped unexamined.
2. **Collapse whitespace** (all runs of whitespace, including newlines and tabs, to a single
   space; trim the ends). Do this before anything measures or scans the string, so a multi-line
   dump cannot stretch the panel, hide its tail below the fold, or split a credential across a
   line break and slip past step 3.
3. **Scan the WHOLE collapsed string** and **drop the line entirely** if it matches credential-
   or URL-shaped content — `X-Amz-Signature`, `X-Amz-Credential`, `awsSecretAccessKey`,
   `awsAccessKeyId`, or any `http://` / `https://` substring. In that case show only the
   headline plus: *"The export service reported an error that could not be displayed safely.
   The full detail is in the server log."* A dropped line is a worse diagnostic; a leaked
   presigned URL plus access key is a worse incident.
4. **Only then truncate to 300 characters**, with a trailing `…`. A composed status sentence is
   well under that; an echoed request body is not, so the bound is also the tell.

The earlier draft of this spec said to print `message` verbatim and "never replace it with a
generic message." That was wrong for all three paths above — the two job-submission awaits
(`osc-rewrap.ts:126`, `:128`) and the poll read (`osc-job-poll.ts:123`, surfaced through the
`did not complete:` interpolation at `osc-rewrap.ts:152`) — and is superseded by the rules
above:
the *intent* — the acceptance criterion's "surfaces the actual error returned by the verified
`/export` contract" — is met by showing the server's own sentence when the server composed it,
which the rules preserve. What they forbid is rendering an unbounded upstream string.

**The real fix belongs on the API surface, not here.** Composing a known sentence for every
failure — the way the non-success-status path at `osc-rewrap.ts:149` already does — would make
the 502 `message` uniformly safe.

**State the precondition as a property of the message, not as a position in the code.** The
sanitiser above may be dropped **only when no `rewrap_failed` 502 `message` can contain upstream
text at all** — i.e. every reachable `message` is drawn from a closed set of repo-authored
sentences whose variable parts are repo-controlled values (a job name, a status from a known
allow-list), with **no interpolation of any `Error.message` originating in the SDK**, directly
or via a prefix.

An earlier draft stated this positionally — "every `await` outside the bounded `try` is
wrapped" — and that test is wrong twice over. It passes `osc-job-poll.ts:123`, which is
*inside* the `try` and still unbounded, because the `catch` at `osc-rewrap.ts:151-153`
interpolates `err.message` into the `did not complete:` sentence at `:152`. And it would pass
any future `catch` that wraps an await in repo prose while still interpolating the raw cause —
wrapping is not bounding. Three concrete consequences of the property-based test:

- Wrapping `createJob` alone is **not** sufficient; `getServiceAccessToken` is subject to the
  identical unbounded SDK error contract (`lib/fetch.js:9,16`).
- Wrapping both submission awaits is **still not** sufficient while `osc-rewrap.ts:152`
  interpolates the poll error. That interpolation must be replaced by a repo-composed sentence
  that carries the upstream text as *data* on the error (the way `OscRewrapJobError` already
  carries the ffmpeg log, §0.1) rather than in `message`.
- Any new `await` anywhere in this runner or its poller — inside or outside the `try` — re-opens
  the hole unless its error is classified into a repo-authored sentence.

File that against `src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts` and `src/pipeline/osc-job-poll.ts` as a
follow-up (§8 item 4). Until the property above holds, the bounding rules are load-bearing. The
honest verification for dropping the sanitiser is a server-side test asserting that the 502
`message` for each induced failure mode matches one of the allowed sentence templates — not a
reading of where the `try` begins.

**Nothing beyond that one sentence.** The ffmpeg log that would explain *why* is deliberately
server-side only (§0.1) — there is no safe additional detail to fetch or display for this
failure, and the UI must not imply there is one (no "see details" affordance that leads
nowhere). Give the diagnostic line `role="status"` so it is announced with the headline rather
than silently (§ "Export succeeded" carries the same note); `role="alert"` is reserved for the
terminal, unrecoverable treatment (§0.4), and an export failure is retryable.

Further constraints on this state:
- The failed child asset itself (`status: 'failed'`, no `objectKey`, §0.1) is not linked to
  from this message — it is not a result the operator can act on (no file exists for it), so
  surfacing it would invite the exact "plausible-looking broken link" #786/#944 eliminated on
  the API side. If the asset list/detail view shows `failed` children generally, that is a
  separate, already-existing surface; this action's own failure message does not need to
  duplicate it.
- The action remains retryable — re-enable the submit control (the `finally` in § "Export in
  progress") with its original label and the operator's last-chosen format/name still filled
  in, since nothing about a `502` says the inputs were wrong (contrast the `400` row in the
  table immediately below, where they were).

**Other failure shapes this action also sends, briefly** (the ticket's acceptance criteria
single out 502 by name, but an implementer reusing this error path needs to know these don't
collide with it):

Each of these is a **fixed plain-string headline through `showMsg`** and nothing else — no
sibling diagnostic, no server string. The bounding rule in this section applies only to
`rewrap_failed`; for every row below the server's `message` is dropped in favour of this copy.

| Status | `error` | Fixed `showMsg` string (`error`) |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `unsupported_format` from the defensive guard, or — at the edge — some other `error` value whose exact envelope is unverified (§0.1); either way the UI matches on `error !== 'rewrap_failed'` and never echoes `message` | **"Unsupported export format."** — should not occur through the UI's own format picker (it would only enumerate `REWRAP_FORMATS`), so this is a defensive message, not a primary design target |
| `404` | `not_found` | **"This asset no longer exists."** — existence is deliberately not distinguished from "not yours" (§0.1); do not say "not found or access denied" or any phrasing that narrows which |
| `409` | `no_object` | **"{SOURCE NAME} has no stored file to export."** — `message` is the shared, generic sentence (§0.1) used by every other source-consuming operation; prefer naming the asset over echoing `message` verbatim here, since the generic sentence reads oddly attached to a specific asset in a UI |

---

## 5. State: export is not available on this deployment (501)

**Trigger:** `501` from `POST /:id/export`, body `{ error: 'not_configured', message: 'export
/ re-wrap is not configured' }` (§0.1). This is the export action's own
nowhere-to-run condition: the deployment wired neither a re-wrap runner nor workspace
storage. It is **not** the destinations state — that one is § "No export destinations are
configured", and the two have different remedies (§0.2's two-condition table).

**When to detect it:** ahead of the click, not after. The UI should probe this ahead of time
(e.g. once per asset-detail render, or once per session, depending on how the implementer
wires the surrounding panel) rather than only surfacing it as a failed submit — the whole
point of #796's "explain, don't fail opaquely" criterion is that an operator should see the
unavailable-and-why state **before** investing effort in picking a format and a name. If the
implementer chooses to detect it lazily on first submit instead, the per-request copy below
still applies unchanged — the only difference is timing, not wording.

**Visual treatment:** do not render the export action as a live form with a doomed submit
button. Follow the established "disabled, with reason" convention already used for optional
pipeline steps (`notConfiguredText`, §0.4), not a `.msg-error` block (this is not something
that just happened and might work on retry — it is the deployment's standing state) and not
`.msg-unrecoverable` either (that component's copy and `data-outcome="unrecoverable"`
semantics are specific to a 410 tombstone, §0.4 — reusing it verbatim here would borrow
language about purging that doesn't apply). Use a dedicated, disabled-looking block in the
same position the active form would occupy:

> **Export is not available on this deployment**
> This deployment has not configured an export service. Ask an operator to provision export
> before this action can be used here.

- Title line names the condition explicitly (per the acceptance criterion) — "Export is not
  available on this deployment", not "Error" or "Something went wrong."
- Body line explains *why* in terms an operator (this UI's actual audience, not an end
  viewer) can act on: provisioning is a deployment-level configuration gap, not something
  retried by clicking again. Do not say "try again later" — nothing about retrying changes
  this state; it changes only when an operator reconfigures the deployment.
- No format picker, no filename field, no submit button rendered in this state — graying out
  live inputs implies "temporarily disabled," which contradicts the box above it. This
  mirrors the version-chain spec's "observed state, not an operator choice" principle
  (`docs/design/asset-version-chain.md` §0 gap 1) applied to availability rather than to
  version selection.
- `data-outcome="not-configured"` on the block (new value, not `"unrecoverable"` — this is a
  deployment config state, not a permanent per-asset outcome), so a test or a future view can
  assert on it the same way `renderPurgedUnrecoverable` already does for its own outcome
  (§0.4).

---

## 6. State: no export destinations are configured

**Which action this belongs to.** The *delivery* action, `POST
/api/v1/assets/{id}/deliver` — the only endpoint on the asset-detail surface that requires an
operator to name a `destination` (§0.2). The export/re-wrap action has no destination field
and never reaches this state; an implementer must **not** add a destination picker to the
export form. This state is in this spec because it is issue #911's "zero destinations
configured" acceptance criterion, and because both actions live on the same panel, so their
unavailable states must not read as the same thing.

**Trigger.** `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` answers `200`, but every entry has `id ===
'default'` — i.e. `destinations.filter(d => d.id !== 'default').length === 0` (§0.2). The
registry is wired; nothing deliverable is registered in it. This is the standing condition of
any deployment where no one has yet called `POST /api/v1/export-destinations`.

**Why this is a real state and not a theoretical one** (correcting an earlier draft of this
document): the array is never literally empty, because `StorageBackendRegistry.list()`
unconditionally prepends `defaultBackendView()`. But the delivery endpoint answers `400
bad_request` for `destination: 'default'`, because `resolveForOutput` returns `undefined` for
`DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID` by design (§0.2). A list of exactly one unusable entry is zero usable
destinations.

**When to detect it:** on render of the delivery control, from the destinations fetch the
picker needs anyway. One request, no extra round trip: the same `GET
/api/v1/export-destinations` response that would populate the picker's options is what
reveals that there are none.

**Visual treatment:** render the same kind of dedicated, disabled-looking block as § "Export
is not available on this deployment" (shared shell, `.msg` metrics without `.msg-error`), in
the position the destination picker and Deliver button would occupy. Copy:

> **No export destinations are configured**
> Delivery copies this asset's file to a storage destination you have registered. This
> deployment has none yet — the platform-managed default store is where the file already
> lives, so it cannot be a delivery target.
> Register a destination with the role **"packaged"** or **"both"**, then come back.

- Title line names the condition in the issue's own terms, and in the contract's noun
  ("destinations", § "Vocabulary").
- The second line answers the first question a first-time operator has — *what is a
  destination for?* — before telling them they don't have one. One sentence, no jargon; it
  does not mention buckets, roles, endpoints, or credentials.
- The third line is the one piece of jargon that cannot be avoided, because it is a literal
  contract value: only `role: 'packaged'` or `'both'` backends are export destinations
  (`isExportDestination`, §0.2). Quote the values exactly as the API spells them so an
  operator can match them against the registration form.
- Do **not** say "try again later" and do **not** say "ask an operator to provision" — unlike
  the 501 state, this one is fixable *by the person reading it*, through this API's own
  registration endpoint (`POST /api/v1/export-destinations`). Point at the action, not at
  someone else.
- If the surrounding UI has (or later gains) a destinations-management view, the block's last
  line should be a link to it rather than prose naming the endpoint. Until that view exists,
  naming the capability ("register a destination") without a dead link is the honest option —
  no affordance that leads nowhere (same rule as § "Export failed"'s "no 'see details'").
- `data-outcome="no-destinations"` on the block — a third, distinct value, not
  `"not-configured"`: a test must be able to tell "this deployment cannot deliver at all"
  from "this deployment can deliver but nothing is registered", because the two have
  different remedies (§0.2).
- **No destination picker and no Deliver button rendered in this state.** An empty or
  default-only `<select>` next to a live button is the same dishonesty as a doomed submit.
- The `default` entry is excluded from the picker in *every* state, not just this one — it is
  always present in the list and always a `400` if submitted (§0.2). Filter it out at the
  point the options are built, so there is one filter and not one per state.

**The neighbouring 501.** If `GET /api/v1/export-destinations` answers `501 not_configured`
instead (registry not wired at all — §0.2), that is the *other* condition and takes the 501
copy pattern, with delivery's own subject:

> **Delivery is not available on this deployment**
> This deployment has no storage-backend registry configured, so export destinations cannot
> be registered or used. Ask an operator to provision one.

Use `data-outcome="not-configured"` for that one, matching § "Export is not available on this
deployment". The distinction is not cosmetic: one tells the reader to act, the other tells
them to escalate.

**Out of scope here.** The delivery action's own in-progress / delivered / failed states
(`200 delivered`, `409 source_missing`, `422 backend_role` /
`destination_unresolved`, `502 delivery_failed`, `504 delivery_timeout` — all in §0.2's
`openapi.json` citation) are a separate ticket. #911 asks only for the no-destinations state,
and that is what this section pins.

---

## 7. Summary table (for the implementer)

Reminder for every `showMsg` cell below: the string is **plain text**, no markup, and the box
**self-removes after 6s** (§0.4). Anything in the "persists" column is separate sibling DOM that
is *not* on that timer.

| State | Action | Trigger | `showMsg` type / plain string / block | Persists (sibling DOM) | Inputs | Retry semantics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| In progress | export | request in flight (client-side only, §0.1: no server poll state) | `info`, `"Exporting to {FORMAT}…"` | nothing — replaced within the request | disabled | n/a |
| Exported | export | `201` | `success`, `"Exported to {FORMAT}."` | **yes** — result row: name link (`data-asset-id` → `showAssetDetail`) + `copyableIdCellHtml` id | re-enabled, cleared | n/a — action is done |
| Export failed | export | `502 rewrap_failed` | `error`, `"Export to {FORMAT} failed."` | **yes** — one `.text-mono` diagnostic line carrying the server sentence, **bounded/sanitised** per § "Export failed" | re-enabled, **preserved** | retryable, same inputs likely to work later |
| Unsupported format / unknown asset / no source object | export | `400`/`404`/`409` | `error`, fixed per-status copy (§ "Export failed" table) | nothing — server string is dropped | re-enabled (400: cleared format; 404/409: n/a, asset-level) | 400/409 need different operator input or asset state; 404 is not retryable |
| Export not available | export | `501 not_configured` | dedicated disabled block, `data-outcome="not-configured"` | **the block itself** — not a `showMsg`, so no timer | not rendered | not retryable by the operator — deployment-level |
| No destinations | deliver | `GET /export-destinations` `200` with no entry whose `id !== 'default'` | dedicated disabled block, `data-outcome="no-destinations"` | **the block itself** — not a `showMsg`, so no timer | picker + button not rendered | fixable by the reader — register a destination |
| Delivery not available | deliver | `GET /export-destinations` `501 not_configured` | dedicated disabled block, `data-outcome="not-configured"` | **the block itself** — not a `showMsg`, so no timer | not rendered | not retryable by the operator — deployment-level |

---

## 8. Contract gaps (do not design around them, design *for* them)

1. **No partial-progress signal.** The export action is awaited end-to-end server-side with
   no job id exposed to the caller (§0.1). A UI cannot show elapsed time against a known
   duration or a cancel affordance; § "Export in progress" is deliberately indeterminate.
2. **`type: 'export'` is a declared-but-unassigned enum member** on `assetFileSchema`
   (§0.3). Any future implementation that tries to identify an exported file by that type
   value will match nothing; match by `objectKey` instead, or treat this as a small follow-up
   to file against the API surface (same-repo note, not OSC friction — this is our own
   schema).
3. **The destinations list includes an entry the delivery endpoint rejects.** `GET
   /api/v1/export-destinations` always contains the implicit `default` (role `'both'`, so it
   passes `isExportDestination`), while `POST /:id/deliver` answers `400` for it because
   `resolveForOutput` returns `undefined` for `DEFAULT_BACKEND_ID` by design (§0.2). Both
   halves are deliberate, but together they mean **no single response field tells a client
   whether a listed destination is deliverable** — every client must hard-code the
   `id !== 'default'` filter. Worth a follow-up on the API surface (a `deliverable: boolean`
   on the list view, or omitting the default from the destinations projection) so the rule
   lives in the contract instead of in each UI. Until then, § "No export destinations are
   configured" specifies the filter so at least this UI applies it once.
4. **The 502 `message` is one unstructured string, and only sometimes one this repo wrote.**
   There's no machine-readable failure-reason field, so copy cannot branch on failure cause
   (e.g. "the source was corrupt" vs. "the container doesn't support this codec") — there is only
   the string. And **three** paths return that string unbounded (§0.1): the two job-submission
   awaits `getServiceAccessToken` (`src/pipeline/osc-rewrap.ts:126`) and `createJob` (`:128`),
   plus the poll read `getJob` (`src/pipeline/osc-job-poll.ts:123`), whose `FetchError` is
   caught at `osc-rewrap.ts:151-153` and interpolated raw into the `did not complete:` sentence
   at `:152`. So the UI has to sanitise what should have arrived safe: § "Export failed" spends
   four ordered steps on defending against a leak that server-side composition would remove
   outright. The follow-up on the API surface has three parts: (a) wrap the two submission
   failures in composed sentences; (b) stop interpolating `err.message` at `osc-rewrap.ts:152`
   — classify the poll failure into a repo-authored sentence and carry the upstream text as
   data on the error, as `OscRewrapJobError` already does for the ffmpeg log; (c) add a stable
   `reason` field so copy can branch on cause instead of printing prose. Note (b) explicitly:
   it is easy to "fix" (a) alone and believe the sanitiser can go, because `:123` sits *inside*
   the bounded `try` — it is unbounded anyway. The removal test is the message-property one in
   § "Export failed", not a positional one. The underlying SDK limitation is logged as OSC
   friction in the agents repo:
   `docs/osc-feedback/incoming-client-core-job-submission-unbounded-error-text.md` (`@osaas/client-core`
   0.24.0 — `defaultErrorFactory`, `lib/fetch.js:5-20`, puts the upstream response body verbatim
   in `Error.message` with no length bound and no structured cause; `createInstance`,
   `lib/core.js:76-91`, does not forward `createFetch`'s `errorFactory` parameter, so a caller
   cannot bound it at the source either).
